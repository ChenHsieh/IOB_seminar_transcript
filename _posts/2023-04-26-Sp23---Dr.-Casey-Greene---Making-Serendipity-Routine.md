## Transcript

![00:00:00.000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=0)	leading to his first paper, which is affiliated with the Department of Genetics here at UGA.

![00:00:15.100](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=15)	The Green Lab develops machine learning methods to integrate disparate large-scale datasets,

![00:00:21.300](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=21)	develops deep learning methods for extracting contacts from these datasets, and then brings

![00:00:26.020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=26)	these capabilities to molecular biologists through open and transparent science.

![00:00:32.140](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=32)	Of particular note to folks interested in large language models, like CHAT-GPT, Dr.

![00:00:38.580](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=38)	Green and others recently posted a preprint on how AI might be able to help us write and

![00:00:44.260](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=44)	revise our academic manuscripts.

![00:00:47.420](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=47)	Please join me in welcoming Dr. Casey Green to UGA.

![00:00:54.420](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=54)	Okay, thank you, yeah, it's good to be back.

![00:01:04.700](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=64)	I actually spent a summer working in this building in the Department of Genetics.

![00:01:09.380](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=69)	Everything around this building looks different now, but somehow the building still looks

![00:01:11.860](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=71)	the same.

![00:01:14.500](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=74)	I'm excited to get a chance to share some of what we've been doing in our group and

![00:01:19.980](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=79)	then to share some of what's going on at the University of Colorado and sort of give you

![00:01:23.140](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=83)	an idea of what the ecosystem is like where we are.

![00:01:27.980](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=87)	I think it's always important to think about kind of what our role as informaticists in

![00:01:34.180](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=94)	science is, like what do we bring to the ecosystem, and I like to think of what we contribute

![00:01:40.140](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=100)	as essentially serendipity, right?

![00:01:42.900](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=102)	If we do our jobs well, people will see something in their data that they hadn't seen before,

![00:01:46.580](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=106)	and they will make a different decision based on that.

![00:01:49.020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=109)	So I like to, you know, think about how we can make more kind of serendipitous moments.

![00:01:55.540](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=115)	I'll start with a brief vignette of a project that we started quite a few years ago now

![00:02:02.940](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=122)	trying to understand rare diseases.

![00:02:07.860](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=127)	And in particular, what factors might drive a rare, what systemic factors might drive

![00:02:13.500](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=133)	a rare disease.

![00:02:16.340](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=136)	The world when we started this project was one where looking across multiple data sets

![00:02:22.260](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=142)	remained somewhat challenging.

![00:02:24.460](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=144)	It's time consuming, you have to deal with batch and technical artifacts.

![00:02:28.980](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=148)	And so our question when we started, a postdoc joined the lab and the idea was, well, you

![00:02:33.380](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=153)	know, here's the gap that we're facing.

![00:02:35.180](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=155)	If you want to analyze multiple data sets at the same time, to identify systemic factors,

![00:02:40.060](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=160)	that means you're looking at different tissues, probably looking at different cohorts, there's

![00:02:44.180](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=164)	potentially different disease contexts, might be different controls.

![00:02:48.060](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=168)	All of this makes your life a lot harder, you can't just kind of make an assumption

![00:02:50.900](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=170)	that you're going to do three different t tests and be done with it.

![00:02:55.100](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=175)	And so what this postdoc wanted to do was say, okay, can I find these commonalities

![00:02:59.980](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=179)	without it taking an inordinately large amount of time.

![00:03:03.180](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=183)	And she was very interested in not taking an inordinately large amount of time because

![00:03:07.780](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=187)	the strategy that she used in her PhD, before she joined the group, was developed, she developed

![00:03:14.300](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=194)	this approach using a modular framework to analyze these data sets, where you essentially

![00:03:17.740](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=197)	take different data sets, decompose them into modules, and then try to map a module in one

![00:03:23.220](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=203)	data set to a module in another data set to a module in another data set.

![00:03:27.100](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=207)	This is possible, if you're an expert in the disease, and you're an expert in all the tissues

![00:03:31.340](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=211)	that sort of are affected, you can do this, you can say, okay, this is this pathway response

![00:03:36.340](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=216)	in this tissue, and this is this other pathway response in this other tissue, but it's really

![00:03:39.740](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=219)	time consuming.

![00:03:40.740](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=220)	And the complexity grows essentially, with at least the square of the number of modules

![00:03:47.460](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=227)	that you want to look at.

![00:03:48.460](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=228)	So you sort of restrict yourself to a modest number of modules if you want to do this in

![00:03:51.380](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=231)	any practical amount of time.

![00:03:53.580](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=233)	There are potentially ways to automate this, you know, using over representation analysis

![00:03:57.060](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=237)	or other strategies to try to, you know, make life easier on the mapping stage, so you don't

![00:04:00.940](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=240)	spend a lot of time looking at stuff that's unlikely to be fruitful.

![00:04:04.220](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=244)	But either way, it's challenging, it takes a bunch of time and it requires a lot of expertise.

![00:04:10.100](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=250)	So what Dr. Jacqueline Tironi did was say, well, what I really want is a module library,

![00:04:15.980](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=255)	like how could this process or cell type be represented in any data set that I look at,

![00:04:21.220](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=261)	I'd like to be able to pull that off the shelf, and then take that module library to different

![00:04:26.100](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=266)	data sets, and then look at each of those data sets in terms of those modules and just

![00:04:30.420](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=270)	look directly across those modules.

![00:04:31.580](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=271)	I don't have to now sort of do the module connection after the fact, I can do it upfront.

![00:04:37.500](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=277)	This would be great, wouldn't it be great if.

![00:04:41.460](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=281)	And so her hypothesis was that, you know, these modules don't just exist in one data

![00:04:46.220](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=286)	set, they exist across human biology.

![00:04:48.180](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=288)	So could she, so her hypothesis was that she would be able to learn these reusable modules

![00:04:54.540](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=294)	by taking many, many, many different data sets, decomposing those different data sets

![00:04:58.700](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=298)	into modules, and then sort of learning which modules were necessary to reconstruct the

![00:05:04.260](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=304)	original data.

![00:05:06.180](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=306)	And then once she did that, she could do that on a generic collection of data, and then

![00:05:10.180](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=310)	hopefully be able to use that on her data sets of interest.

![00:05:12.860](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=312)	And in this case, we're interested in studying a disease called Enka-associated vasculitis,

![00:05:17.580](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=317)	which is rare enough that if you look at large collections of public RNA-seq data, you don't

![00:05:22.060](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=322)	find it.

![00:05:23.680](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=323)	So it's quite a rare disease.

![00:05:28.500](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=328)	So the idea here was, if she took a whole bunch of generic samples, essentially random

![00:05:31.700](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=331)	human data that she downloaded from the internet, transcriptomic data, she decomposed that,

![00:05:35.900](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=335)	she could decompose that into patterns, and then she could take those patterns and we

![00:05:39.620](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=339)	could apply those to the rare disease data sets of interest, and potentially do sort

![00:05:42.980](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=342)	of standard statistics with that.

![00:05:45.940](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=345)	We, just to give you an idea of the data set that we started with, so this is a data set

![00:05:52.500](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=352)	ReCount 2, I think there's now a ReCount 3.

![00:05:56.100](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=356)	This is produced by Jeff Leak's group at Hopkins.

![00:05:59.220](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=359)	And if you wanted 70,000 RNA-seq samples, you can just get 70,000 uniformly processed

![00:06:04.660](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=364)	RNA-seq samples.

![00:06:05.660](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=365)	What I like to tell Jackie is that her project had to be successful, because if you think

![00:06:11.140](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=371)	about the resources we were giving her to start it, if you just benchmark that those

![00:06:14.260](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=374)	samples probably cost about $1,000 to generate, you know, I like to tell her, look, we gave

![00:06:18.780](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=378)	you $70 million to start your project, you have to do something with $70 million, right?

![00:06:23.460](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=383)	So, this was the data that we used, and then we tried quite a few different methods to

![00:06:29.300](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=389)	extract patterns, including some that we developed in our group, but we ended up coming to this

![00:06:34.300](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=394)	method called PLYR, which is from Maria Shakina's group at Pitt.

![00:06:39.260](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=399)	And PLYR is the Pathway-Level Information Extractor, and it does a couple things that

![00:06:44.340](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=404)	are really nice.

![00:06:45.340](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=405)	So, it's essentially doing this matrix decomposition, but as you do the matrix decomposition, there's

![00:06:50.540](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=410)	a couple sort of regularization factors and some penalties in it, and essentially, it

![00:06:55.580](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=415)	has some sparsity properties that we really like, so the idea is that you want to be able

![00:06:59.420](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=419)	to explain a dataset with relatively few latent variables.

![00:07:02.740](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=422)	Also, you want your latent variables to have only a modest number of genes in them.

![00:07:07.300](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=427)	And finally, if those latent variables can align with a pathway, you'd really prefer

![00:07:12.740](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=432)	that the latent variable align with a pathway, because anytime you're doing this decomposition,

![00:07:16.220](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=436)	you're essentially doing some arbitrary rotation, right?

![00:07:19.180](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=439)	PCA is essentially learning an arbitrary, it's learning a rotation of your data, a reduced

![00:07:25.380](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=445)	dimension space rotation of your data.

![00:07:28.380](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=448)	The rotation in PCA is essentially arbitrary, I mean, you've chosen that you want to maximize

![00:07:33.340](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=453)	the variance on the first axis, but you could have chosen anything else, like ICA, you're

![00:07:37.740](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=457)	just like, I don't care, just make it small.

![00:07:41.020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=461)	So in this case, what it's doing is it's essentially saying, if a pathway can line up with an axis,

![00:07:46.100](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=466)	let's do that.

![00:07:47.260](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=467)	And so it's a little bit less, that's the intuition for what it's doing, it's actually

![00:07:52.620](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=472)	a little bit, the regularization is a little bit different than that.

![00:07:56.700](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=476)	And what that gives you is a really nice level of interpretability.

![00:07:59.340](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=479)	So instead of having to think about a module as, like, instead of saying, okay, this cell

![00:08:03.700](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=483)	type is, these three different axes of variability added in some fraction, usually those cell

![00:08:08.980](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=488)	types are going to come out as a single axis in your data.

![00:08:11.060](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=491)	So it makes it much more easy to think through and reason about the solutions.

![00:08:18.100](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=498)	And so what we essentially did is say, okay, well, we have this enormous collection of

![00:08:22.260](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=502)	generic human data from the internet, ReCount2, and we have a plier, and we'd like that to

![00:08:26.940](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=506)	be a machine learning model that we could use in many different biological contexts.

![00:08:30.380](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=510)	So we named it multi-dataset plier, but because in bioinformatics, everything has to have

![00:08:34.900](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=514)	a name, we just shortened that to multiplier.

![00:08:38.780](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=518)	And so this is kind of a multiplier idea.

![00:08:41.380](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=521)	I'm just going to give you a couple highlight results from the paper that I think help to

![00:08:47.540](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=527)	kind of give an idea of why you might want to do this.

![00:08:49.820](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=529)	The paper is pretty exhaustive.

![00:08:51.500](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=531)	It has a significant deep dive into sort of exactly what's happening in this stuff, but

![00:08:55.340](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=535)	I'll just give you kind of the high points.

![00:08:59.580](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=539)	Essentially what we wanted to understand is, does this model learn something we didn't

![00:09:03.660](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=543)	already know?

![00:09:05.740](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=545)	And is it better than if you just took data from the disease of interest?

![00:09:10.180](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=550)	We couldn't get enough data from the disease of interest, which is psychosociative vasculitis.

![00:09:13.700](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=553)	So we did that analysis in the paper, and we just didn't learn many axes of variability

![00:09:19.540](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=559)	because there's too little data.

![00:09:21.020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=561)	So what we wanted to do is say, well, let's pick something where we could actually learn

![00:09:24.460](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=564)	something.

![00:09:25.460](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=565)	Let's sort of give this idea a chance.

![00:09:27.220](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=567)	And then we said, well, let's imagine we're studying a different autoimmune disease, lupus.

![00:09:31.220](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=571)	So that's what's here, where it says SLE, this box plot.

![00:09:35.660](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=575)	What we've done is we've collected all the whole blood data that we could get from individuals

![00:09:39.940](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=579)	with lupus that was publicly available to create one collection of data.

![00:09:45.260](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=585)	Then what we've done with RECOUNT2, which is the generic human data from the internet,

![00:09:48.780](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=588)	is we've taken RECOUNT2 and we've subsampled it to be the same size as the lupus set.

![00:09:53.820](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=593)	So that's the box plot.

![00:09:54.940](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=594)	The box plot is RECOUNT2 subsampled.

![00:09:57.420](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=597)	And then where you see the diamond, that's what happens if you just take the complete

![00:10:00.460](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=600)	collection of data from RECOUNT2.

![00:10:02.460](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=602)	Okay, so let's label our X.

![00:10:04.300](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=604)	Oh, so yeah, so these data sets, if you think about the science behind this, this experiment

![00:10:08.220](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=608)	has these two data sets of the same size, but different composition.

![00:10:12.300](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=612)	These two are the same composition of the data, but they're quite different sizes.

![00:10:16.140](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=616)	I think 70 times larger for the diamond than the other.

![00:10:20.780](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=620)	And so then we can ask, okay, so how many patterns are we learning from our data?

![00:10:23.580](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=623)	So this method uses the latent variable decomposition, so the number of latent variables, which are

![00:10:27.660](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=627)	essentially patterns.

![00:10:29.340](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=629)	You can see that if you want to learn more patterns, there's sort of more, and there's

![00:10:32.860](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=632)	a heuristic and plier for sort of selecting the optimal number of latent variables, and

![00:10:37.140](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=637)	we use that heuristic here, it seems like a pretty reasonable heuristic.

![00:10:40.260](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=640)	It uses cross-validation to essentially ask how frequently you're rediscovering the same

![00:10:45.140](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=645)	latent variables.

![00:10:47.860](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=647)	So if you do that, you find that you can learn more latent variables or recurrent patterns

![00:10:52.900](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=652)	in the data if you have less heterogeneity in your data given a fixed sample size.

![00:10:56.900](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=656)	I don't think this is going to shock anyone, right?

![00:11:00.420](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=660)	If I give you a limited amount of data, you would like that data to be as consistent as

![00:11:03.900](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=663)	possible except for the thing you'd like to vary, right?

![00:11:06.620](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=666)	That's usually a good place to live.

![00:11:10.060](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=670)	So that's what we see here, right?

![00:11:11.340](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=671)	You get more latent variables out of the lupus data than the subsampled recount2 data, but

![00:11:15.740](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=675)	if I told you, well, you can have really messy data, but you can have a lot of it, now you

![00:11:19.460](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=679)	can learn a lot more patterns.

![00:11:21.080](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=681)	So you end up with many fold more patterns that you can learn, the kind of recurrent

![00:11:25.500](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=685)	patterns across the data set if you have more data.

![00:11:27.620](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=687)	So you'd rather have less heterogeneity, but sometimes having more samples can overcome

![00:11:32.780](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=692)	the heterogeneity issue.

![00:11:37.300](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=697)	So that's the first thing we ask.

![00:11:38.300](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=698)	So you get kind of more total patterns.

![00:11:40.060](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=700)	The next thing we can ask is, okay, well, we don't know what complete collection of

![00:11:47.440](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=707)	processes are transcriptionally co-regulated, right?

![00:11:50.060](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=710)	This is not something we know a priori.

![00:11:51.460](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=711)	We can get a collection of processes if we go to Gene Ontology or KEGG or other databases,

![00:11:55.940](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=715)	but some of those may not be transcriptionally co-regulated.

![00:11:58.060](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=718)	However, if we're seeing a process that's coming out as transcriptionally co-regulated,

![00:12:02.620](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=722)	that's probably a positive hit.

![00:12:04.860](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=724)	And so that's kind of the assumption we're making here.

![00:12:06.700](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=726)	So this is looking at both the SLE and the ReCount2 data again.

![00:12:10.820](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=730)	This axis is what fraction of the pathways that we know about are coming back as sort

![00:12:16.580](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=736)	of aligned with one or more axes in the data.

![00:12:20.580](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=740)	And so you can see this actually wasn't driven by composition of the data, this was driven

![00:12:24.660](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=744)	by sample size.

![00:12:25.660](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=745)	So if you put in more data, you can learn kind of more transcriptional co-regulation.

![00:12:30.580](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=750)	This obscures a little bit of what's going on here because the processes are a little

![00:12:34.060](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=754)	bit different.

![00:12:36.460](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=756)	If you look at what happens in the ReCount2 data, you end up learning, as you get to the

![00:12:41.740](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=761)	large sample size, you end up learning more granular processes.

![00:12:45.020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=765)	So it seems like it's probably that you're covering the same things that are transcriptionally

![00:12:48.780](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=768)	co-regulated, you just get a higher level of resolution.

![00:12:52.740](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=772)	And then, so you kind of learn more of the stuff we know we should know about.

![00:12:56.780](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=776)	So at this point, anything I'm showing you, you could also do with GSEA or any of these

![00:13:00.580](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=780)	other methods, gene set enrichment analysis, or those types of methods.

![00:13:03.820](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=783)	But we can also ask, can we learn anything we didn't already know going in?

![00:13:07.620](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=787)	So this is asking what fraction of the latent variables that are coming back are not associated

![00:13:14.620](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=794)	with the pathway.

![00:13:17.100](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=797)	And what you can see is, when you have the sort of more modest sample sizes, about half

![00:13:23.140](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=803)	of the latent variables that come back were associated with the pathway, and the other

![00:13:25.700](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=805)	half are potentially novel.

![00:13:27.580](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=807)	Could be novel biology, it could be a technical artifact.

![00:13:31.460](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=811)	What you see when you get the large collection of ReCount2 data is, you know, that number

![00:13:35.420](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=815)	drops to about 20%.

![00:13:36.420](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=816)	So 80% of the latent variables that are coming back didn't exist in the databases that we

![00:13:40.300](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=820)	had available to us going into it.

![00:13:42.100](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=822)	So that's a really nice thing to have in your back pocket if you want to say, well, look,

![00:13:46.780](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=826)	I want to explore the biology of what's going on in this disease, but I don't want to limit

![00:13:50.580](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=830)	myself to what people have curated into a database.

![00:13:53.020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=833)	So this is kind of a data-driven way to figure out what those modules could be.

![00:13:58.380](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=838)	And you might also say, well, there's probably just an enormous amount of technical artifacts.

![00:14:01.700](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=841)	You just told me you gathered a whole bunch of random human data from the internet.

![00:14:05.360](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=845)	One of the positive things that we saw that was kind of suggestive that this is not driven

![00:14:09.140](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=849)	exclusively by technical artifacts is actually this proportion bumps up a little bit when

![00:14:13.900](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=853)	you look at the ReCount2 data, as opposed to the SLE data.

![00:14:17.140](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=857)	If it was entirely driven by technical artifacts, you'd actually expect this to have fewer latent

![00:14:21.460](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=861)	variables that were associated only with a known process.

![00:14:25.420](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=865)	So this was also encouraging.

![00:14:28.300](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=868)	So this gives us the idea that we kind of learn more unknown unknowns.

![00:14:31.980](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=871)	And then there's quite a bit more of a deep dive in the paper, like looking at sort of

![00:14:36.380](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=876)	one of the things that we see is instead of having a cell cycle latent variable, you end

![00:14:39.540](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=879)	up with different phases of the cell cycle partitioned into latent variables.

![00:14:43.660](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=883)	But the sort of takeaway was that if you do these machine learning analyses while reusing

![00:14:49.640](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=889)	data from other contexts, you can get this level of detail that you couldn't get just

![00:14:54.040](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=894)	analyzing your data alone.

![00:14:55.840](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=895)	So starting with a whole bunch of other data, learning the pathways and processes there,

![00:14:59.520](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=899)	and then applying it to your data gives you this higher level of resolution.

![00:15:02.800](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=902)	There is a bit of an implicit assumption here, which is if the process that you were looking

![00:15:07.040](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=907)	at is truly unique and only occurs in your setting and no other settings, you can't find

![00:15:12.240](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=912)	it because it's not going to be present in the variability from other people's data.

![00:15:16.920](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=916)	I think this is probably rare.

![00:15:19.560](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=919)	I don't think it's terribly common that there are processes that are so exclusive that they're

![00:15:23.400](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=923)	only used in one and only one biological context and nowhere else.

![00:15:27.120](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=927)	But if you believe that to be the case, you should know you will not find it with this

![00:15:29.800](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=929)	method.

![00:15:32.800](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=932)	And so then just kind of recapitulating.

![00:15:34.480](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=934)	So in the past, when Jackie joined the group, she had this modular framework approach, which

![00:15:39.680](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=939)	is actually really nice and is now used, it's been used in scleroderma and other contexts

![00:15:46.280](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=946)	to connect pathways across tissues and studies.

![00:15:50.240](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=950)	But the multiplier approach she developed has some nice advantages.

![00:15:53.480](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=953)	So she takes this generic human data, recount two, she can train a model, then transfer

![00:15:57.520](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=957)	it to the datasets of interest, and then just look across those datasets with standard statistics.

![00:16:02.320](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=962)	So this is an example of one of the things we can do with this.

![00:16:06.080](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=966)	So this was actually the thing we wanted to do when we started the study.

![00:16:10.040](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=970)	So these are three different datasets from individuals with ANCA-associated vasculitis.

![00:16:15.200](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=975)	One of the challenges here is that all of these datasets are microarray-based.

![00:16:19.840](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=979)	All of our training data is RNA-seq.

![00:16:22.560](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=982)	A different student in the lab developed a technique to do, if you're interested in taking

![00:16:27.240](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=987)	sort of machine learning methods and applying them to gene expression data across these

![00:16:33.920](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=993)	contexts, for many methods, there's reasonable ways to do that transformation that is not

![00:16:41.040](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1001)	completely horrendous, which is the best advertisement I can get for a method.

![00:16:47.280](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1007)	But there's quite a few different methods.

![00:16:48.280](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1008)	And actually, quantile normalization is not bad in this context.

![00:16:51.760](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1011)	The zeros kind of give you a bit of trouble, but it's not horrendous.

![00:16:55.400](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1015)	And so this is what we're doing here.

![00:16:57.680](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1017)	So we're actually asking, can the multiplier model actually apply to array datasets, even

![00:17:03.200](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1023)	though it's trained exclusively in RNA-seq data?

![00:17:05.000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1025)	We would have done this in RNA-seq data, but it turned out there wasn't RNA-seq data for

![00:17:08.920](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1028)	this that was available yet.

![00:17:10.840](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1030)	So now we've gotten to the point where the datasets for this disease are large enough

![00:17:13.040](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1033)	that they actually do exist in RNA-seq as well.

![00:17:16.440](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1036)	So what's going on here?

![00:17:18.080](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1038)	So we've got three different datasets, airway epithelial cells, renal glomeruli, and PPMCs.

![00:17:23.160](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1043)	They're collected in three different studies, so there's no matched people.

![00:17:26.800](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1046)	And also the conditions are brutally different.

![00:17:28.960](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1048)	So what's going to happen is from the left side to the right side of each of these plots,

![00:17:32.640](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1052)	we're going to go from the least, from the most severe form of the disease to sort of

![00:17:36.360](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1056)	the least severe form of the disease for healthy controls.

![00:17:39.360](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1059)	So this dataset for the airway epithelial cells has, these are the vasculitis data,

![00:17:45.320](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1065)	but then it's got things like pancreatic rhinitis, healthy.

![00:17:49.280](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1069)	And so we're basically saying, okay, what is associated with severity across these three

![00:17:55.640](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1075)	different cohorts?

![00:17:58.160](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1078)	And so one of the latent variables that comes up as a severity associated is this M0 macrophage

![00:18:03.040](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1083)	signature.

![00:18:04.360](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1084)	And you can see the same thing where in each group you look in, the least severe form of

![00:18:09.640](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1089)	the disease is on the right, the more severe form of the disease is on the left.

![00:18:12.280](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1092)	So you can see this latent variable severity associated due to the bizarre sort of path

![00:18:17.440](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1097)	of academic publishing.

![00:18:20.040](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1100)	So our guess was that M0 macrophages could be involved here.

![00:18:24.280](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1104)	Well, before this actually was published, but after the preprint came out, we had some

![00:18:29.000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1109)	follow-up work.

![00:18:31.640](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1111)	And I have to break all the chronology of science.

![00:18:34.280](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1114)	Our follow-up work came out first demonstrating that it looked like there was a change in

![00:18:38.400](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1118)	macrophage metabolism in the disease that could be sort of influencing severity in a

![00:18:43.240](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1123)	systemic way.

![00:18:44.880](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1124)	You can also use this type of analysis to say what's particular to a tissue, right?

![00:18:48.400](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1128)	So you could say what latent variables are associated with severity in this tissue, but

![00:18:52.560](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1132)	not other tissues.

![00:18:53.720](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1133)	So it gives you the ability to start doing those analyses in a way that it's pretty darn

![00:18:56.920](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1136)	difficult to do with just the modular framework alone.

![00:19:03.760](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1143)	And then I have an almost five-year-old, she turns five in three weeks, and she's been

![00:19:08.560](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1148)	watching Zootopia.

![00:19:10.680](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1150)	And there's a line in a song in Zootopia where I was listening, I'm like, oh my gosh, this

![00:19:15.040](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1155)	is science.

![00:19:18.760](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1158)	So the line is, I'll keep on making those new mistakes.

![00:19:21.680](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1161)	I'll keep on making them every day, those new mistakes.

![00:19:25.120](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1165)	And so we're really big on this in the lab, right?

![00:19:27.840](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1167)	But what I tell people is, it's not going to work, just make it not work differently

![00:19:33.160](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1173)	each time.

![00:19:34.160](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1174)	If it's not working the same way each time, that's not good, but if it's not working for

![00:19:37.240](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1177)	different reasons, that's perfect.

![00:19:40.080](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1180)	And so we do this in our own work.

![00:19:41.700](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1181)	So this is the first part of the GitHub that's rate me that's associated with this paper.

![00:19:47.660](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1187)	So if you want to know sort of, these are all notebooks, if you want to follow along

![00:19:51.480](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1191)	with the work that we did for this multiplier paper.

![00:19:54.360](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1194)	The first part of this is kind of our proof of concept exploration to just understand

![00:19:57.720](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1197)	how the method worked.

![00:19:58.720](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1198)	Then you get to the stuff that's in the paper, then you get to the stuff that's in the supplement,

![00:20:03.280](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1203)	then you get to the stuff that's neither in the paper nor the supplement, because it turned

![00:20:06.080](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1206)	out the paper was too long.

![00:20:08.080](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1208)	And so this gives you a way to see like, okay, here's all the stuff we did.

![00:20:12.480](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1212)	So there was one experiment that we did where we wanted to say, can you predict outcome

![00:20:15.640](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1215)	in clinical trials from these latent variables?

![00:20:18.220](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1218)	And so we got this Rituximab data set from the NIH that was testing this.

![00:20:23.000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1223)	It turned out that the data set structure was, let's say, suboptimal, in that some of

![00:20:27.800](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1227)	it was paired end and some of it was not paired end sequencing.

![00:20:31.320](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1231)	And this was confounded with the endpoint.

![00:20:33.880](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1233)	So it turned out to be extremely difficult to analyze, and we couldn't really learn anything

![00:20:37.800](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1237)	from it.

![00:20:38.800](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1238)	But if you're interested in using that for your own work, probably not that data set,

![00:20:43.160](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1243)	that idea.

![00:20:44.160](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1244)	You know, we've got a notebook here that's like, okay, here was our attempt to build

![00:20:48.040](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1248)	a model to predict response.

![00:20:49.240](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1249)	So you can start from that.

![00:20:50.480](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1250)	So if you're interested in this, we try to do this for each of our papers.

![00:20:55.840](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1255)	So this is available.

![00:20:56.840](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1256)	The GitHub is here.

![00:20:58.400](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1258)	If you search for Taroni and multiplier, you'll probably find it.

![00:21:03.080](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1263)	But I thought this was a nice example of kind of how we've taken a project from inception

![00:21:07.960](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1267)	through execution through kind of deliverables.

![00:21:11.000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1271)	This method, we've seen some other uses now.

![00:21:13.640](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1273)	So someone used the same thing to study neurofibromatosis.

![00:21:17.600](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1277)	That came out relatively recently.

![00:21:19.120](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1279)	I can't remember, there's a few other sort of rare disease analyses that people have

![00:21:23.120](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1283)	started using this for.

![00:21:24.120](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1284)	But we really like seeing that, right?

![00:21:25.120](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1285)	Because it demonstrates uptake that is in a, I mean, rare disease transcriptomics is

![00:21:31.120](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1291)	a relatively small community.

![00:21:33.800](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1293)	So it's nice to see this stuff beginning to catch on.

![00:21:37.880](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1297)	I would also say, you know, we started with about $70 million worth of data.

![00:21:44.240](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1304)	If you are Lego Grace Hopper and you happen to have an internet connection, you can have

![00:21:48.280](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1308)	about $4 billion worth of data at your fingertips.

![00:21:51.600](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1311)	So if you're interested, there's a few more resources that have come online.

![00:21:55.800](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1315)	I think Arches 4 now has like 650,000 samples.

![00:22:00.040](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1320)	So that's about, you know, if you want to estimate $650 million of preprocessed data

![00:22:04.120](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1324)	at your fingertips.

![00:22:05.960](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1325)	In a previous position, we built something called Refined Bio that's about a million

![00:22:08.920](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1328)	samples.

![00:22:11.240](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1331)	So these types of resources are available, which is great, because then you don't have

![00:22:14.120](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1334)	to go back and rebuild this.

![00:22:15.680](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1335)	You don't have to do all the software engineering to reprocess the data in a uniform way.

![00:22:18.960](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1338)	You just kind of start from the processed data.

![00:22:21.560](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1341)	And I think this opens up a lot of avenues of exploration.

![00:22:26.600](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1346)	I like to, you know, one of the things that I say about what our lab works on is machine

![00:22:31.880](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1351)	learning, public data, and the transcriptome.

![00:22:33.680](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1353)	Pick two of three, and we're probably interested.

![00:22:37.040](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1357)	One of our Bush essentially wrote and designed the way that we fund science in this country.

![00:22:42.840](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1362)	So this idea that most science is going to happen outside of government research labs,

![00:22:46.280](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1366)	it's mostly going to happen at universities, it's mostly going to be grant funded.

![00:22:49.800](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1369)	He wrote this letter to FDR that says, the pioneer spirit is still vigorous within this

![00:22:54.080](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1374)	nation science offers a largely unexplored hinterland for the pioneer who has the tools

![00:22:58.080](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1378)	for his task.

![00:22:59.080](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1379)	Well, I would say, I think open data is like the opportunities here are remarkable, like

![00:23:05.840](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1385)	the ability to, you can take these data sets off the shelf and learn how something works

![00:23:11.520](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1391)	at a scale that's very difficult to do from the data generated in only one lab.

![00:23:15.760](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1395)	And once you do that, you can then test it.

![00:23:17.360](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1397)	And I think I really think using other people's data as sort of the starting point to generate

![00:23:20.920](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1400)	hypotheses that you then go test.

![00:23:24.080](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1404)	There's an enormous amount of unexplored opportunity here.

![00:23:28.080](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1408)	We also think sometimes about other data types instead of just gene expression.

![00:23:31.640](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1411)	So this is work from David Nicholson, who was a PhD student in the lab who just graduated

![00:23:35.840](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1415)	last year, who was like, well, let's do that.

![00:23:38.120](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1418)	I just want to understand what's on bioRxiv anyway.

![00:23:41.960](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1421)	So at this point, I probably don't have to introduce it, bioRxiv is a preprint server.

![00:23:46.760](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1426)	And so this gives us the ability to also study the peer review process in some ways.

![00:23:50.560](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1430)	So we can see what gets posted to bioRxiv, and then we can look at the sort of what the

![00:23:54.040](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1434)	final paper looks like.

![00:23:56.160](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1436)	We started this project just around the time that bioRxiv released an XML repository of

![00:24:03.240](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1443)	their complete collection of data.

![00:24:04.920](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1444)	So if you're interested in not just having a complete collection of transcriptomic data,

![00:24:08.120](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1448)	you can also go get a complete collection of XML preprints, which I think is really

![00:24:11.640](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1451)	exciting and a lot of fun.

![00:24:15.240](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1455)	You learn some things if you start looking at just the metadata associated with this.

![00:24:18.800](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1458)	So this is one of the simple questions that David asked was just, well, if there are preprints

![00:24:25.160](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1465)	with multiple versions, are people sort of adjusting their preprint in response to peer

![00:24:29.160](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1469)	review?

![00:24:30.280](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1470)	So if someone submits their paper, they get comments back, do they generally repost it?

![00:24:34.040](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1474)	We can't directly answer that question, we don't have access to the journal system.

![00:24:36.920](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1476)	But we could say as well, if that were happening, probably what would happen is that at each,

![00:24:41.520](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1481)	you know, as you saw in each version, you'd see an extension in the time to publish.

![00:24:45.120](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1485)	Sure enough, you see that.

![00:24:46.120](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1486)	And actually, the coefficient on the X here is about 50, which is in days.

![00:24:53.080](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1493)	So it suggests that adding a version means sort of 50 days longer in the publication

![00:24:57.000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1497)	process, which is kind of aligned with what you'd expect to see if people are putting

![00:25:00.560](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1500)	up papers and revising them in response to peer review.

![00:25:06.520](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1506)	Another thing we can ask, so this is getting into the text itself, is if the text changes,

![00:25:13.480](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1513)	do more changes in text between the preprint and the published version result in, does

![00:25:18.320](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1518)	that come with a longer time to publish?

![00:25:20.640](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1520)	And the answer to that is kind of yes-ish.

![00:25:23.400](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1523)	If a preprint changes more from the, if a published version changes more from the preprint,

![00:25:28.560](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1528)	it does take a bit longer to publish.

![00:25:31.000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1531)	But it's not an incredibly substantial change.

![00:25:33.840](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1533)	And actually, the other thing that we did, so as we were doing this project, there was

![00:25:36.560](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1536)	another group that did a completely different project, where they took a set of COVID papers

![00:25:42.420](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1542)	that were published first as preprints and followed them through.

![00:25:45.480](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1545)	Their scientific question was different.

![00:25:46.800](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1546)	They wanted to say, for COVID-related papers, does the message of the paper change as it

![00:25:52.080](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1552)	goes through the publication process?

![00:25:53.080](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1553)	And they found that only in one case did that happen out of the 300-odd papers that they

![00:25:56.480](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1556)	examined.

![00:25:57.480](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1557)	But what that gave us was an annotated list of COVID papers.

![00:26:00.100](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1560)	So we could then take that and ask if it had the same relationship, and it actually didn't

![00:26:03.280](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1563)	have the same relationship.

![00:26:04.800](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1564)	So for the subset of the literature in early 2020, COVID papers were being published quickly

![00:26:10.460](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1570)	regardless of how much text changed between the preprint and published version.

![00:26:14.400](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1574)	So this was kind of an interesting way to explore how publishing was happening.

![00:26:18.280](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1578)	So for those of you who have had the opportunity to have papers go through peer review, can

![00:26:24.080](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1584)	you guess what the most common linguistic change is, if we just look at word-level linguistic

![00:26:28.800](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1588)	change during the publishing process?

![00:26:39.200](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1599)	Has anyone ever had to add supplementary or additional data?

![00:26:43.000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1603)	It's not the most common.

![00:26:44.480](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1604)	The most common is actually, oh, no, it is the most common, yeah.

![00:26:48.280](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1608)	So additional and file.

![00:26:49.280](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1609)	So on the right here is what's enriched in the published literature, and the left is

![00:26:53.320](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1613)	what's enriched in preprints.

![00:26:55.280](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1615)	So file and additional and supplementary are all pretty high at the top.

![00:26:58.800](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1618)	So when people are changing their papers, we can infer that probably they're often changing

![00:27:04.280](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1624)	the, you know, they're adding stuff to the supplement, but maybe they're not adding that

![00:27:08.040](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1628)	much to the main paper.

![00:27:09.640](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1629)	The other stuff that's in there is kind of interesting, like fig and figure.

![00:27:12.560](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1632)	So because journals have different styles, the plus-minus symbol and the em dash.

![00:27:16.640](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1636)	So you can see the artifacts of typesetting, but this gives a way to kind of understand

![00:27:22.960](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1642)	what's on each side.

![00:27:23.960](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1643)	And this, I should say, we've done this, so this analysis is using only preprint published

![00:27:28.360](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1648)	pairs.

![00:27:29.360](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1649)	If you do the same thing with all of BioRxiv and all of PubMed, you essentially find field

![00:27:32.760](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1652)	differences.

![00:27:33.760](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1653)	So some fields use BioRxiv more than others.

![00:27:35.400](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1655)	So this is the more carefully controlled than that.

![00:27:39.040](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1659)	The other thing that we've done, just if you happen to have a preprint yourself, we have

![00:27:42.960](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1662)	this web server that does a linguistic comparison between a selected preprint and all of PubMed

![00:27:51.720](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1671)	and says, okay, well, here's journals that publish linguistically similar papers.

![00:27:57.320](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1677)	Here's papers that are linguistically similar to yours, and this has a secret feature.

![00:28:01.640](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1681)	So what we encourage people to do, and we designed it to try to get people to upload

![00:28:04.400](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1684)	their preprint, but then people are like, well, I have a preprint, but it's on archive

![00:28:06.920](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1686)	and you don't support archive.

![00:28:08.880](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1688)	So the secret feature, which you can also drag a PDF over the search box if you want

![00:28:11.720](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1691)	to, but we don't generally advertise that because the goal was to get people to post

![00:28:18.880](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1698)	preprints so they could use the service, but we don't support archive.

![00:28:21.560](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1701)	So if you have an archive preprint, we'll allow you to put, to drag it over the search

![00:28:25.760](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1705)	box, but no other PDFs.

![00:28:30.520](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1710)	So this came out last year, and there's, again, a GitHub associated with it if you want to

![00:28:34.800](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1714)	see all the kind of exploration that we did on the way.

![00:28:38.480](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1718)	David had a follow-up paper that I'm really excited about where he looked at, he looked

![00:28:44.480](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1724)	at the, what words change their meaning over time, and in the last 20 years of scientific

![00:28:51.200](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1731)	publishing.

![00:28:52.200](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1732)	So there's an application associated with that as well that I should have put the link

![00:28:55.520](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1735)	on here, but didn't, that we call WordLabs.

![00:28:57.800](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1737)	So if you go to our lab and look for WordLabs, you'll find that, and it's really interesting.

![00:29:02.640](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1742)	So we see things like hallmarks of new technologies, like, you know, CRISPR has a linguistic shift.

![00:29:07.520](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1747)	We also see a lot of pandemic-associated words have linguistic shifts.

![00:29:13.080](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1753)	So if you're interested in understanding how our language changes, that's also something

![00:29:16.760](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1756)	that David did.

![00:29:19.040](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1759)	Okay, and then I know this is a less medically-related audience than most of the places that I speak,

![00:29:28.360](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1768)	but one of the things that I thought I wanted to share was sort of how some of this basic

![00:29:34.000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1774)	science or sort of the techniques that we develop in this basic science can contribute

![00:29:37.120](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1777)	to changes in how healthcare gets delivered.

![00:29:40.040](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1780)	And so this is also something that we think about, right?

![00:29:43.480](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1783)	Remember our business is serendipity.

![00:29:44.960](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1784)	Yes, sometimes that's in research, right?

![00:29:47.080](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1787)	Whether that's sort of me telling you how papers change, so that you can think about

![00:29:50.560](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1790)	how you would change your paper in response to peer review, just add more additional files.

![00:29:55.160](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1795)	But sometimes that's, you know, in care, in clinical care, right?

![00:29:59.200](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1799)	So that someone, you know, you can imagine a patient comes in, there might be reasons

![00:30:02.720](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1802)	that that patient might need to receive a different treatment.

![00:30:04.720](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1804)	Could we provide that kind of information at the point of care?

![00:30:07.920](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1807)	So this is a big focus at our med school and our health system that's associated with our

![00:30:15.000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1815)	med school, University of Colorado Health, has an entire program in clinical intelligence.

![00:30:21.440](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1821)	This is sort of the idea that I like to highlight as sort of serendipity is like the right moment

![00:30:27.000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1827)	at the right time to make the right decision.

![00:30:30.440](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1830)	In most health systems, if someone is going to get something called pharmacogenomic genetic

![00:30:35.600](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1835)	testing.

![00:30:36.600](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1836)	So the idea here is people have different variants in their genome.

![00:30:39.580](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1839)	Some of those variants can affect how you metabolize drugs, how you respond to different

![00:30:42.640](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1842)	drugs.

![00:30:44.280](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1844)	It's not terribly common that people get tested for pharmacogenomic variants, because if you

![00:30:49.600](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1849)	go get, if you are going to a hospital and, you know, you need to have a stent inserted,

![00:30:54.800](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1854)	one of the common treatments is Plavix, well, there's a, there's an interaction between

![00:30:59.080](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1859)	Plavix and a certain genetic variant, a set of genetic variants where you metabolize the

![00:31:02.760](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1862)	drug differently, and it doesn't work for you, which means you're not getting the benefit

![00:31:05.680](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1865)	of reducing your heart attack risk, or your clot risk.

![00:31:09.800](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1869)	And so, but most people don't get this testing, because if a physician orders the testing,

![00:31:14.560](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1874)	they get a 70 page PDF back, then they have to take that 70 page PDF and go to a table

![00:31:18.840](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1878)	like this, read everything related to the drug they're about to prescribe, to prescribe

![00:31:22.560](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1882)	on the table, and then understand if it applies, right?

![00:31:25.360](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1885)	That is not a common thing for a physician to do.

![00:31:28.160](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1888)	Providers don't get reimbursed for that type of type of work.

![00:31:31.480](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1891)	What's happening at the University of Colorado and UC Health is we've got clinical decision

![00:31:35.320](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1895)	support built into the electronic health record around this stuff.

![00:31:38.280](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1898)	So this is the same thing, except instead of a 70 page PDF, plus having to look at this

![00:31:42.640](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1902)	table, if a provider were to go in and order Plavix for an individual who's not going to

![00:31:48.640](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1908)	benefit from it, it pops up an alert that says, look, we recommend you remove this because

![00:31:52.160](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1912)	it's not going to work, and read about why it's not going to work if you want to, but

![00:31:56.000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1916)	we recommend you apply one of these alternatives that will work for this patient.

![00:31:59.200](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1919)	And so this is serendipity, but not just in research, in clinical care.

![00:32:04.520](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1924)	And this is, if you're interested in this kind of story, this is another one.

![00:32:08.400](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1928)	This was an individual, different condition, where there was a question about drug efficacy.

![00:32:12.920](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1932)	This is a story from UC Health.

![00:32:16.120](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1936)	And in this case, the provider keyed in an order, and an alert popped up that says, oh,

![00:32:20.480](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1940)	this person's going to need a different dose.

![00:32:23.280](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1943)	And that was helpful to the provider to make that decision.

![00:32:26.640](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1946)	One of the things I've had the privilege of doing over the last couple of years is focusing

![00:32:31.400](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1951)	on this program.

![00:32:32.400](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1952)	So a lot of faculty in our department work in this program, and about a year and a half

![00:32:37.000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1957)	ago, I guess two years ago, the previous director left, and so I ended up as the interim director.

![00:32:42.480](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1962)	So I've gotten to know this program pretty well.

![00:32:44.920](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1964)	So this is our Colorado Center for Personalized Medicine.

![00:32:48.080](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1968)	We have a biobank study that this is all tied to.

![00:32:50.800](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1970)	So if someone comes in, they can consent to have their sample collected for the biobank.

![00:32:55.080](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1975)	We have a robust return of results pipeline built on that.

![00:32:57.920](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1977)	So our biobank is growing pretty rapidly.

![00:33:00.600](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1980)	Our sample increase is picking up a lot.

![00:33:02.720](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1982)	But then the other thing we ask is, how is this making a difference in care?

![00:33:05.800](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1985)	So essentially, how many of these alerts are actually firing?

![00:33:08.560](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1988)	So over the last year, we've had about 1,000 patients who've had an alert fire at some

![00:33:14.320](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1994)	point in clinical care.

![00:33:16.360](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=1996)	That's a tenfold increase over our entire previous history.

![00:33:20.200](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2000)	And that's been powered because we've recently focused on getting these results back into

![00:33:26.280](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2006)	the EHR in a structured way.

![00:33:27.560](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2007)	So we've seen almost 100-fold growth, actually more than 100-fold growth year over year.

![00:33:31.800](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2011)	We'll probably have 210,000 results in the electronic health record at sort of the two-year

![00:33:35.800](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2015)	mark.

![00:33:37.080](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2017)	And what this means is that if you're interested in studying this type of process in terms

![00:33:42.080](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2022)	of care delivery, if you're interested in studying how physicians respond, if you're

![00:33:45.600](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2025)	interested in looking for new cases where there are these sort of drug-gene interactions,

![00:33:50.560](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2030)	we have the ingredients to do that at Colorado in a way that no one else that I'm aware of

![00:33:54.240](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2034)	does.

![00:33:55.720](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2035)	And so this program continues to grow.

![00:33:58.200](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2038)	I'll just give you one.

![00:33:59.240](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2039)	This is actually a real story that happened over the last few months.

![00:34:03.320](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2043)	So this is a stock photo.

![00:34:04.320](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2044)	I cannot show you a picture of the patient, but a patient came in to a community oncology

![00:34:09.280](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2049)	clinic.

![00:34:10.480](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2050)	And this works across the entire UC health system.

![00:34:12.160](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2052)	So it's not just an academic hospital.

![00:34:13.680](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2053)	This is a major health system that serves the Mountain West.

![00:34:17.360](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2057)	So this patient came into a community oncology clinic.

![00:34:20.280](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2060)	They were prescribed a drug that based on their genetic variants would have created

![00:34:27.480](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2067)	a significant risk of life-threatening complications.

![00:34:33.520](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2073)	Our team noticed this, sent a message to the provider, and then the patient alert actually

![00:34:41.400](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2081)	fired and recommended a reduced dosage of the drug.

![00:34:45.000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2085)	The oncologist actually did proactively reduce the dose.

![00:34:48.000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2088)	So the person started at a different dose than would traditionally be used.

![00:34:53.680](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2093)	Even at that dose, they didn't tolerate it very well.

![00:34:55.600](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2095)	So they had to further reduce the dose.

![00:34:57.840](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2097)	In these types of cases, you can imagine what happens if you start at the highest sort of

![00:35:01.200](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2101)	the traditional dose at which these drugs can be for individuals with this particular

![00:35:05.920](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2105)	variant can be lethal.

![00:35:07.720](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2107)	And so this is a case where, you know, yes, I told you there's 1,000 alerts, but each

![00:35:11.680](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2111)	of those 1,000 alerts is some story like this, right?

![00:35:14.360](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2114)	And so it's nice to see this actually being used to deliver care at scale.

![00:35:19.640](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2119)	And so we're doing this, this is all informatics, right?

![00:35:23.040](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2123)	You can get all of this serendipity with sort of none of this here has machine learning

![00:35:27.160](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2127)	built into it, but it's going to.

![00:35:30.480](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2130)	And as we think about that, I think it's really important not just to sort of think

![00:35:33.920](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2133)	from the machine learning point of view, but to really think about practical clinical care

![00:35:37.360](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2137)	pathways.

![00:35:38.360](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2138)	So this is a piece from Siddhartha Mukherjee that sort of, if you're interested in AI and

![00:35:44.160](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2144)	medicine, I realize this is dated now, but it's still worth reading.

![00:35:49.040](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2149)	And it's also weird that five years is old, but it's still worth reading.

![00:35:54.320](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2154)	It has a quote from Geoffrey Hinton, sort of says they should stop training radiologists

![00:35:57.800](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2157)	right now.

![00:36:00.440](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2160)	And why would someone say this, right?

![00:36:03.280](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2163)	Well, so Geoff Hinton's looking at the literature, right?

![00:36:05.480](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2165)	So they're just trying to collect some literature from around the same time.

![00:36:08.760](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2168)	So this is sort of saying, look, deep learning is going to completely transform healthcare.

![00:36:11.680](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2171)	It's going to change how we care as we know it.

![00:36:14.840](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2174)	Another sort of similar example, more examples, everything you read in the literature, deep

![00:36:20.000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2180)	learning.

![00:36:21.000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2181)	Like, I mean, now we're all into large language models, but at the time these image models

![00:36:23.760](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2183)	were going to completely transform healthcare.

![00:36:25.600](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2185)	Well, you might ask, is there anything they're not good at?

![00:36:29.080](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2189)	Like they're good at everything, right?

![00:36:31.440](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2191)	Chihuahuas and blueberry muffins, not terribly good here.

![00:36:37.000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2197)	This one's kind of wild.

![00:36:42.520](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2202)	So I perceive the thing on the left as a panda.

![00:36:44.840](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2204)	It looks like a picture of a panda.

![00:36:48.160](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2208)	I don't really perceive this as much of anything.

![00:36:51.640](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2211)	We're going to add, you know, this plus seven thousandths of this.

![00:36:56.520](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2216)	What do you think the output is going to look like?

![00:37:02.120](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2222)	A sloth.

![00:37:03.120](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2223)	A sloth?

![00:37:04.120](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2224)	Any Gibbons?

![00:37:05.120](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2225)	Anyone for Gibbon?

![00:37:06.120](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2226)	A bear.

![00:37:07.120](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2227)	A bear?

![00:37:08.120](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2228)	Okay.

![00:37:09.120](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2229)	So this is what it looks like.

![00:37:10.120](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2230)	It's a Gibbon.

![00:37:11.120](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2231)	Clearly a Gibbon.

![00:37:12.120](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2232)	No question.

![00:37:13.120](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2233)	That's a Gibbon.

![00:37:14.120](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2234)	A monkey.

![00:37:15.120](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2235)	Okay.

![00:37:16.120](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2236)	So it doesn't look like a Gibbon to me, but our neural network is exceedingly convinced.

![00:37:26.080](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2246)	And the reason this works, right, is because the decision boundaries in these neural networks

![00:37:29.200](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2249)	are sort of nonlinear, and you can end up pretty close to a decision boundary without

![00:37:32.360](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2252)	really knowing it.

![00:37:34.200](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2254)	This is another example, which I think is just a lot of fun, so I have to throw it in.

![00:37:38.160](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2258)	So this is someone who was like, well, can I just make adversarial, like, sticker?

![00:37:43.040](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2263)	Like, can I have a sticker that I can put on something and have a deep neural network

![00:37:46.960](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2266)	perceive it as something, even if it's not?

![00:37:49.360](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2269)	So this is the toaster sticker.

![00:37:52.600](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2272)	And so you can give, you can put the toaster sticker on a table next to what I perceive

![00:37:56.960](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2276)	to be a, I perceive this to be a toaster sticker on a table next to a banana.

![00:38:01.480](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2281)	I perceive this to be a banana on a table.

![00:38:05.320](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2285)	Neural network classifier, banana on a table.

![00:38:07.240](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2287)	It's good.

![00:38:08.240](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2288)	Stick the toaster sticker next to it?

![00:38:09.960](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2289)	Absolutely a toaster.

![00:38:10.960](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2290)	You can imagine doing the same things with stop signs, you can imagine doing the same

![00:38:15.520](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2295)	things with other fun technologies in the world of self-driving cars or deep neural

![00:38:21.120](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2301)	networks or vision.

![00:38:22.120](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2302)	Okay, so let's go back to the automated radiologist finding pneumonia.

![00:38:26.200](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2306)	This was one of the examples I showed you before.

![00:38:29.200](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2309)	There's a, John Zek is a guy who writes blog posts that are really good and then converts

![00:38:34.720](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2314)	them into papers.

![00:38:36.600](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2316)	So this was a blog post from John Zek, which then became a paper that sort of said, okay,

![00:38:41.480](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2321)	why is the system actually working?

![00:38:43.120](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2323)	Like what's happening here?

![00:38:45.200](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2325)	So he went to the, to the images and tried to understand, you know, what part of the

![00:38:51.080](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2331)	image is contributing to the prediction of pneumonia?

![00:38:53.920](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2333)	Well in this case, a positive, and this should probably find pneumonia.

![00:38:58.480](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2338)	There's high density in the lung here.

![00:39:01.760](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2341)	You can say, well, okay.

![00:39:02.760](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2342)	Oh, and I should say a positive number is suggestive of pneumonia, a negative number

![00:39:09.240](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2349)	is not.

![00:39:10.240](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2350)	Okay.

![00:39:11.240](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2351)	So what are the positive numbers?

![00:39:15.360](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2355)	The most positive numbers, bottom, yeah, where there's this interesting stripe, the interesting

![00:39:22.720](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2362)	stripe that's kind of unique characteristic of the scanner, the one that you might see

![00:39:26.800](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2366)	if you were in a department, if the scanner was placed proximal to sort of where pneumonia

![00:39:31.440](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2371)	diagnoses were usually occurring.

![00:39:33.840](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2373)	Yeah.

![00:39:34.840](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2374)	So, so, so that's interesting.

![00:39:38.240](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2378)	Here's another one.

![00:39:40.800](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2380)	I should say these probabilities are low, but the previous one was in the 99th percentile

![00:39:44.320](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2384)	for pneumonia.

![00:39:45.320](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2385)	This one's in the 95th percentile.

![00:39:47.320](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2387)	Yeah.

![00:39:48.320](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2388)	Portable?

![00:39:49.320](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2389)	Portable.

![00:39:50.320](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2390)	Someone's not well enough to go to the scanner.

![00:39:52.600](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2392)	Not a good sign for their health, could indicate pneumonia.

![00:39:55.860](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2395)	Probably not the part of the image you want to be looking at.

![00:39:59.320](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2399)	And so, you know, I think this to me, I was also reading this every once in a while, I

![00:40:05.200](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2405)	read the comment section of blog posts on the internet, which I do not recommend, but

![00:40:08.960](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2408)	there was one on big data.

![00:40:09.960](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2409)	You know, there was this blog post on big data and I'm like, well, it was like why statistics

![00:40:14.320](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2414)	don't matter in the era of big data or something like that.

![00:40:16.800](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2416)	And I'm like, okay, I'll, you know, and then I'm like, I have some disagreements with this.

![00:40:21.040](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2421)	Then I go to the comment section, I find this one, which I really agree with.

![00:40:25.720](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2425)	On big data, data collection biases are always larger than statistical uncertainty.

![00:40:29.680](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2429)	And I think this is why I sort of, you know, you can have these models that perform robustly

![00:40:33.560](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2433)	around a lot of these comparisons that still struggle.

![00:40:36.200](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2436)	And then I read, who made the post, and it's this guy named Daniel Himmelstein, which probably

![00:40:39.240](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2439)	doesn't mean anything to you, but he happened to be a postdoc in my lab.

![00:40:42.160](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2442)	And I'm like, dude, put this in the comment section of the internet, people should actually

![00:40:46.440](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2446)	read it.

![00:40:47.440](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2447)	So now I put it on slides, so at least someone can see it.

![00:40:51.120](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2451)	Okay, so how do we design systems that work?

![00:40:54.600](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2454)	So you know, for AI and medicine, regardless of what we're using, I think we need to have

![00:40:59.080](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2459)	some principles that we think about.

![00:41:01.520](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2461)	We just did something that sort of tries to go on this path.

![00:41:05.400](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2465)	So this is a little bit different.

![00:41:06.960](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2466)	So this is a piece from Nature, but it talks about a preprint that we put up earlier this

![00:41:11.800](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2471)	year, where we were trying to use GPT-based models, so in this case, GPT-3, to revise

![00:41:17.600](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2477)	academic manuscripts.

![00:41:19.280](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2479)	One of the things that we see all the time is, well, now it's really common, right?

![00:41:23.440](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2483)	People are developing services that can use GPT-3 or ChatGPT, or GPT-4 through ChatGPT

![00:41:30.240](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2490)	to revise your manuscript.

![00:41:31.240](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2491)	Well, what are the issues with those?

![00:41:33.560](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2493)	So our experience putting this together and running a bunch of test manuscripts through

![00:41:36.360](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2496)	it is that, yes, it is good at clarifying language.

![00:41:40.280](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2500)	There's a lot of things it can help you with.

![00:41:42.800](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2502)	It actually caught an error in an equation, which I was pretty darn impressed with.

![00:41:47.480](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2507)	On the other hand, it also makes stuff up.

![00:41:50.640](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2510)	And so a bit of a challenge if your idea is that you're just going to use this.

![00:41:54.480](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2514)	And I think, you know, I use this as an example because it's really trivial.

![00:41:59.240](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2519)	You can try it out yourself and see how it works, and you can get these examples yourself.

![00:42:03.360](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2523)	The same things are going to be true when we use this in medical context, so we need

![00:42:06.840](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2526)	to think about them.

![00:42:07.840](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2527)	I think thinking about them and trying them and experimenting in a low-risk environment

![00:42:11.440](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2531)	before we move to a high-risk environment is usually a good idea.

![00:42:14.440](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2534)	So what are the principles that we've kind of come up with as we think about this?

![00:42:17.440](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2537)	So first, we really do aim for kind of an augmentation, not replacement.

![00:42:22.440](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2542)	And what that means is, you know, when we apply this to manuscripts and we try to get

![00:42:27.760](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2547)	it to improve it, you know, we actually applied it to the manuscript about the tool.

![00:42:32.520](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2552)	And when we did that, it made up this thing that we had done that we had fine-tuned the

![00:42:36.200](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2556)	model on manuscripts of a similar type.

![00:42:38.240](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2558)	Yeah, you should absolutely fine-tune the model on manuscripts of a similar type.

![00:42:41.920](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2561)	Makes a ton of sense.

![00:42:43.200](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2563)	We didn't do it.

![00:42:44.200](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2564)	You probably shouldn't report that you did it in the manuscript.

![00:42:48.360](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2568)	So we're really thinking like, you know, okay, this is not like you're going to plug it in,

![00:42:52.280](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2572)	you're going to be done.

![00:42:53.280](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2573)	It's really, you need to design it around kind of an augmentation capability.

![00:42:56.760](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2576)	You've got to carefully consider your use cases.

![00:43:00.000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2580)	You know, if it's easy to take the output, it's hard to compare.

![00:43:03.280](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2583)	It's probably not good, right?

![00:43:04.800](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2584)	Because you're creating the opportunity for a mistake that you don't need to create.

![00:43:09.240](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2589)	We really like to start with these kind of simple solutions and approaches and layer

![00:43:11.960](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2591)	complexity only as needed.

![00:43:13.320](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2593)	So in this case, you know, we start with some pretty simple prompts and then have the ability

![00:43:20.080](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2600)	to add complexity.

![00:43:21.280](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2601)	But usually we just kind of try to keep it relatively basic and simple.

![00:43:25.200](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2605)	The workflow is simple.

![00:43:26.640](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2606)	You can proof of concept it out really quickly.

![00:43:28.360](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2608)	And the most important thing is preserving attribution.

![00:43:30.440](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2610)	Like where did the content come from?

![00:43:31.680](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2611)	If you're thinking about this in a clinical setting, you know, what was provided and when?

![00:43:35.760](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2615)	And you know, did it come from an AI or a human first?

![00:43:38.000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2618)	Because that's really going to matter as you're thinking about evaluating these workflows.

![00:43:41.520](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2621)	In academic writing, I think it's going to, you're going to want to keep track of whether

![00:43:45.200](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2625)	something came from an AI based system or if you wrote it.

![00:43:48.960](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2628)	I think this is, more and more journals are starting to require this.

![00:43:51.600](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2631)	It's going to be important.

![00:43:53.520](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2633)	But I just think like these are key principles that I would recommend keeping in mind.

![00:43:59.160](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2639)	And then finally, I just want to give you an idea of what the environment is like about

![00:44:01.680](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2641)	at Colorado.

![00:44:02.680](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2642)	Because some of you may one day look for future jobs and I figure you should know something

![00:44:05.840](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2645)	about us.

![00:44:06.840](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2646)	We're not at Boulder.

![00:44:07.840](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2647)	We're at the Anschutz Medical Campus, which is kind of between the airport and the Denver

![00:44:13.040](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2653)	airport and Denver itself.

![00:44:16.360](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2656)	We are a major academic medical center.

![00:44:19.240](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2659)	And like I said, we're not at Boulder, which is the thing that people most frequently get

![00:44:24.480](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2664)	confused about.

![00:44:25.780](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2665)	On July 1st of last year, we actually launched a new department of biomedical informatics.

![00:44:30.980](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2670)	And you know, we're trying to hire and put together a faculty that are focused on this

![00:44:34.020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2674)	idea of kind of making serendipity routine, like how do you surface the right information

![00:44:37.940](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2677)	at the right time.

![00:44:40.220](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2680)	Our 30, we're now at 31 faculty, we have a new person starting in May, that will get

![00:44:45.260](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2685)	us to 32 faculty, have about $65 million in extramural research, just for faculty who

![00:44:50.340](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2690)	are PIs, on which faculty in the department are PIs, there's a lot of additional collaborative

![00:44:55.340](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2695)	funding that's not included in this.

![00:44:57.620](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2697)	We have expertise kind of across the spectrum from precision medicine, through kind of physiological

![00:45:03.380](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2703)	modeling, we have folks who think about human computer interaction, because if you want

![00:45:06.060](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2706)	to deploy this stuff in the clinic, you should really think about how humans are going to

![00:45:08.740](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2708)	interact with it through kind of electrical engineering, medical imaging and AI.

![00:45:13.580](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2713)	So there's a lot of faculty working in this area.

![00:45:16.940](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2716)	This I just collected some stuff from early last year.

![00:45:21.100](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2721)	And that just sort of like, okay, when our faculty mentioned in the press, so there's

![00:45:24.660](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2724)	stuff in MIT technology review nature, LeMond, Deutschland, I can't remember whatever the

![00:45:32.540](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2732)	German public radio station is.

![00:45:35.500](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2735)	So you know, you have a bunch of internationally renowned experts who are at Anschutz, we don't

![00:45:38.700](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2738)	happen to be at Boulder.

![00:45:39.700](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2739)	You know, to me, it's like the difference between Georgia Tech and Georgia, I feel like

![00:45:44.740](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2744)	they're different institutions, we should probably occasionally recognize that.

![00:45:49.660](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2749)	The other thing that sort of we focused on when we were creating the department, if you

![00:45:53.460](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2753)	read the sociology literature from the 80s, which I suspect all of you do on a regular

![00:45:57.060](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2757)	basis, there's this article that I actually think you should read from the sociology literature

![00:46:02.020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2762)	from the 80s called the mundanity of excellence.

![00:46:04.740](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2764)	So this is someone who essentially studied swimmers at many different levels and asked

![00:46:08.260](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2768)	what differentiates swimmers at one level from another level.

![00:46:12.700](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2772)	There's a few different principles that come out, but one of the key ones is that excellence

![00:46:16.260](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2776)	requires qualitative differentiation.

![00:46:18.620](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2778)	And what I mean by that is, you know, you're not going to move up a level in swimming competitions

![00:46:22.180](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2782)	by swimming to extra labs.

![00:46:24.020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2784)	That's not how it works.

![00:46:25.020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2785)	What you're going to do is you're going to focus on your form, you're going to, you know,

![00:46:28.020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2788)	you're going to approach the sport differently, you're going to focus on getting rest the

![00:46:30.920](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2790)	night before the meet, like that's the stuff that people do at higher levels that they

![00:46:34.340](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2794)	don't do at lower levels.

![00:46:36.660](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2796)	And as we think about a department, we had to ask like, what's our, okay, what's our

![00:46:39.380](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2799)	qualitative differentiator?

![00:46:40.380](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2800)	How are we not just like another biomedical informatics department that just happens to

![00:46:44.220](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2804)	have more money or something, right?

![00:46:45.580](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2805)	Like that's not, that's not a real differentiator.

![00:46:48.460](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2808)	And so what we thought about was creating promotion and tenure guidelines that have,

![00:46:53.580](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2813)	that are focused on real world impact.

![00:46:55.720](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2815)	So one of our bullet points in our departmental sort of idea of impact, there is a bullet

![00:47:00.700](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2820)	point that includes publication.

![00:47:02.220](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2822)	It's possible, you can do it, we can care about it.

![00:47:05.540](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2825)	But there's also technology development that gets deployed locally, nationally or internationally.

![00:47:10.780](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2830)	Software shows up, changes in policy because of your work.

![00:47:14.100](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2834)	All of that is included in and counts for impact.

![00:47:17.100](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2837)	Now, probably not all of you will look for tenure track faculty positions in our department.

![00:47:21.340](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2841)	But if you were to come train or send folks to train with us, I think it's important to

![00:47:26.660](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2846)	know like that filters down, right?

![00:47:28.340](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2848)	If that's how faculty are evaluated, that filters all the way down.

![00:47:30.940](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2850)	So there's an emphasis on real world impact that we have that I think can be our kind

![00:47:34.340](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2854)	of qualitative differentiator.

![00:47:35.340](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2855)	And I'll just say, we have a really good training environment.

![00:47:39.620](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2859)	So we have strong connections with UC Health.

![00:47:41.100](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2861)	So I told you earlier about one of the UC Health programs that we work closely with

![00:47:44.660](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2864)	them on.

![00:47:45.660](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2865)	And Children's Colorado, which is a nationally renowned pediatric cancer hospital, not pediatric

![00:47:51.220](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2871)	hospital.

![00:47:52.220](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2872)	I know the pediatric cancer people work in that space.

![00:47:55.940](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2875)	So we have those tight connections.

![00:47:56.940](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2876)	If you're interested in seeing your work translate to care, we have, if you're interested in

![00:48:01.140](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2881)	using genetics to guide care, I think we have one of the best programs in the country

![00:48:03.620](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2883)	through CCPM.

![00:48:05.340](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2885)	We have a diverse and internationally recognized faculty.

![00:48:08.740](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2888)	One of the things that's sometimes a little bit odd for folks at, you know, our tenure

![00:48:12.680](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2892)	track faculty in DBMI are actually majority women, which I think is uncommon at, in, in

![00:48:19.620](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2899)	our field.

![00:48:21.380](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2901)	And then if you like the climate and you, it's a little bit humid here.

![00:48:24.900](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2904)	We don't have that level of humidity, but we do have more hours of sun per year than

![00:48:28.340](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2908)	Miami and San Diego.

![00:48:29.340](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2909)	So if you're interested in the environment around you, we've got that.

![00:48:31.860](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2911)	And then we've got abundant outdoor activities.

![00:48:34.780](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2914)	This is one example of the programs that we have.

![00:48:36.580](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2916)	So this is our computational science PhD program.

![00:48:39.020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2919)	There's also a postdoc training grant associated with the same thing.

![00:48:44.740](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2924)	So if you're interested in this type of thing, feel free to look us up.

![00:48:47.780](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2927)	You can always drop me an email and I can try to connect you with folks too.

![00:48:51.580](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2931)	And then with that, I just want to thank the people who make this possible.

![00:48:55.860](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2935)	So the members of the lab, we really have a kind of robust culture in the lab of sort

![00:49:00.140](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2940)	of sharing the work that's happening and kind of thinking through each other's projects

![00:49:04.700](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2944)	in ways that are really helpful.

![00:49:06.420](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2946)	We also do code review.

![00:49:07.420](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2947)	So people really pitch out, pitch in together, the department of biomedical informatics and

![00:49:12.060](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2952)	my leadership team, and then the folks in CCPM, since I shared some of that work, and

![00:49:15.660](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2955)	then the folks who give us money, I'd be happy to take whatever questions you have.

![00:49:25.860](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2965)	For the radiology, XAI explainability, did they end up using my grad cam as like how

![00:49:35.340](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2975)	they liberated the convolutional layer for the confluence?

![00:49:41.380](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2981)	Yeah.

![00:49:42.380](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2982)	I don't remember what strategy they used.

![00:49:45.580](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2985)	And I also don't remember, you know, the saliency map.

![00:49:51.220](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2991)	I think it's a saliency map, but I'm not 100% sure.

![00:49:55.580](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=2995)	Yeah, there's a, so John posted that first as a blog post, there's now like a PLOS medicine

![00:50:00.300](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3000)	paper, I think.

![00:50:01.300](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3001)	Yeah.

![00:50:02.300](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3002)	I think I probably, yeah.

![00:50:03.300](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3003)	Yeah.

![00:50:04.300](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3004)	And I wrote this when it was the blog post and not when it was PLOS medicine paper, which

![00:50:07.020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3007)	is what I'd look at.

![00:50:09.020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3009)	Yeah.

![00:50:10.020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3010)	Yeah.

![00:50:11.020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3011)	So with the strange like explainability maps, did that happen even with like augmentations

![00:50:19.540](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3019)	that would rotate or like zoom in, zoom out?

![00:50:22.100](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3022)	Like was that with that, it still happened or with a train without that?

![00:50:26.300](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3026)	Because like, I was thinking like assume in augmentation might solve that bottom band

![00:50:32.540](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3032)	problem.

![00:50:33.540](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3033)	Yeah.

![00:50:34.540](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3034)	So I was wondering if that still.

![00:50:36.780](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3036)	I'm guessing, so this is Andrew Ng's stuff.

![00:50:39.180](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3039)	This was the one that he was criticizing.

![00:50:40.980](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3040)	I think this was just chest x-rays and I don't think they, I don't remember them doing at

![00:50:48.820](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3048)	least like a patch-based augmentation or anything like that.

![00:50:52.020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3052)	Yeah.

![00:50:53.020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3053)	And I would say now some of the techniques that are more sophisticated are likely to

![00:50:57.100](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3057)	control for some of that.

![00:50:58.100](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3058)	I mean, the other thing you could do is you can also just like do some adversarial training

![00:51:01.540](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3061)	around the location of the scanner.

![00:51:04.500](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3064)	The challenge with that is you need to know to do it and to know to do it, you have to

![00:51:07.940](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3067)	like have someone who's an expert probe your data.

![00:51:10.220](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3070)	And I think sometimes when we come to things from a computer science perspective, I do

![00:51:16.300](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3076)	think sometimes we get really excited that something is working and especially if it's

![00:51:22.340](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3082)	working as well as a human and maybe we get a little bit ahead of ourselves and aren't

![00:51:31.780](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3091)	skeptical enough about our own results.

![00:51:36.660](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3096)	So with the pharmacogenomics, the alert system that you pointed out.

![00:51:41.020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3101)	So how often do you get sort of false alerts, right?

![00:51:44.100](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3104)	So because sometimes you can get an alert that a physician may not be really interested

![00:51:52.580](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3112)	in or think is valid, right?

![00:51:54.940](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3114)	Yeah.

![00:51:55.940](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3115)	So we designed this pretty carefully.

![00:51:59.940](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3119)	So we could bump up our alert number by just whether or not someone's getting a relevant

![00:52:05.580](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3125)	prescription, fire the alert.

![00:52:08.380](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3128)	That'd be great for our metrics.

![00:52:09.620](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3129)	On the other hand, not terribly useful for care and people would learn to ignore it.

![00:52:13.660](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3133)	So we're pretty focused.

![00:52:15.060](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3135)	So most of the alerts are non-interruptive.

![00:52:17.260](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3137)	So the idea is an 80-20 rule.

![00:52:19.500](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3139)	So only 20% of the alerts should be interruptive, 80% should be non-interruptive.

![00:52:24.140](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3144)	And because this isn't based on a predictive model, it's pretty straightforward to make

![00:52:29.660](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3149)	sure it fires largely at times when it's relevant.

![00:52:32.220](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3152)	So restricting kind of the clinic in which you can fire and that sort of stuff.

![00:52:36.180](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3156)	However, one of the really nice things about UCHealth, so I'll go back on my advertising

![00:52:39.780](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3159)	pitch for why you should come to Colorado and work at Colorado if this is something

![00:52:42.500](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3162)	you're interested in, UCHealth thought about this in advance.

![00:52:46.660](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3166)	So years ago, they built a virtual health center.

![00:52:49.620](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3169)	And if you want to look it up, you can look up the UCHealth virtual health center.

![00:52:53.500](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3173)	The guy who, to my understanding, put this together and sort of was visionary behind

![00:52:58.060](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3178)	it is a guy named Rich Zane, who's our chief innovation officer through the hospital.

![00:53:03.060](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3183)	And what they did there is they have nurses and clinicians who work offsite, but who are

![00:53:07.780](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3187)	available to look at these types of systems before they flow to people who are onsite

![00:53:12.900](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3192)	providing care.

![00:53:14.260](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3194)	And where this became really useful, so is anyone aware of kind of the EPIC sepsis model

![00:53:19.260](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3199)	thing that blew up maybe a year or two ago?

![00:53:22.820](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3202)	No.

![00:53:23.820](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3203)	So EPIC is one of the major providers of electronic health record systems.

![00:53:26.860](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3206)	They have a sepsis model, and that sepsis model is pretty noisy.

![00:53:31.300](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3211)	It likes to, it alerts probably more frequently than it should, and it misses cases it shouldn't

![00:53:36.380](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3216)	miss.

![00:53:37.420](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3217)	So there was a team at CU before my time, led by Tal Bennett, that had evaluated this

![00:53:43.020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3223)	model and found that it had some predictive quality, but maybe it wasn't ready.

![00:53:50.180](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3230)	I want to be careful what I assert here.

![00:53:52.460](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3232)	It had some predictive quality, but deployed in practice at scale could have created a

![00:53:57.940](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3237)	lot of unnecessary burden on providers.

![00:54:00.620](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3240)	Well, what they did, because they have the virtual health center, is they're able to

![00:54:03.620](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3243)	deploy that model plus others in the virtual health center, have it alert nurses and clinicians

![00:54:11.060](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3251)	there, and then have them look at it carefully in the virtual health center and only send

![00:54:16.260](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3256)	the notice over to the folks who are working at the bedside if it's actually going to be

![00:54:20.100](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3260)	useful.

![00:54:21.100](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3261)	So a reason that could be good to work at Colorado, if you're interested in kind of

![00:54:23.620](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3263)	predictive analytics and deploying this stuff in practice, is you can have a model that's

![00:54:27.460](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3267)	not perfect, right?

![00:54:28.620](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3268)	It doesn't have to be good enough to hand to a provider at the bedside.

![00:54:33.820](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3273)	Because of the virtual health center, you can really proof of concept it out there,

![00:54:37.460](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3277)	improve it, understand how you can improve its predictive quality, and then deploy it

![00:54:40.060](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3280)	when it's ready.

![00:54:41.060](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3281)	But you can still get the benefit in the meantime.

![00:54:42.660](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3282)	So I guess I'd say, yeah, I think our noise level is pretty low on these alerts, but we

![00:54:49.220](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3289)	do have a system in place for noisier stuff if people want to deploy it.

![00:54:57.900](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3297)	It's fun to be back in Athens.

![00:54:58.900](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3298)	Time to go dogs.

![00:54:59.900](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3299)	I don't know what else I should say, but I'm just excited to be back.

![00:55:04.220](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZXvGGO96TI&t=3304)	I was really tickled when I got the invite, it was wonderful.
