## Transcript

![00:00:00.000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=0)	My pleasure to introduce Professor Yang, who joined UGA last semester and as a class chair

![00:00:29.360](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=29)	of ecology, mathematics, and statistics, but he doesn't have any commitment to

![00:00:35.920](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=35)	or ecology. So this seminar also serves for his application for the adjunct position with IOB.

![00:00:45.120](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=45)	So if you're a student and looking for lab, you may want to talk to him. His major research area

![00:00:53.760](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=53)	is infectious disease, and he is a statistician modeling for infectious disease. As you know,

![00:01:00.960](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=60)	to understand infectious disease, we need the knowledge in ecology, population genetics,

![00:01:08.000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=68)	molecular genetics, to understand evolution of pathogens, and mathematics, you know,

![00:01:15.600](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=75)	as well as statistics. So it's very hard to find an expert in all of those areas,

![00:01:21.520](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=81)	and here we go. Professor Yang, so if you're interested in doing research in infectious

![00:01:27.840](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=87)	disease, you probably want to talk to him. He has a lot of grants. He's already published over 100

![00:01:38.160](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=98)	papers, and this is, believe me, this is just the first page of his CV. So I cannot read out

![00:01:46.480](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=106)	all the CVs. It's 19 pages. So he, let's see. Sorry, I'm aging, so I cannot see that. So he

![00:01:57.200](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=117)	got his PhD in 2004 from Emory, and he did his postdoc at Howard, right, so for the following

![00:02:10.240](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=130)	year, and then he worked at Brad Hutchinson Cancer Center, and then he moved to University

![00:02:20.560](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=140)	of Florida, and last semester, he joined again. So today, he's going to talk about epidemiology

![00:02:27.680](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=147)	and ecology of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus.

![00:02:42.160](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=162)	Okay, good. Thank you, Liang, for this nice introduction and over compliment.

![00:02:47.040](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=167)	I'm not expert in everything, and I mainly specialize in modeling of infectious disease

![00:02:56.160](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=176)	transmission, and just started working with Dr. Liu on how to combine the epidemiological part

![00:03:03.280](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=183)	and the physiological part into the same model so that we can better model the dynamics of

![00:03:10.000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=190)	transmission. Today, I'm going to talk about epidemiology and the ecology of MERS-CoV.

![00:03:19.440](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=199)	If you read the flyer before, I changed my title a little bit. I used to have

![00:03:24.560](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=204)	transmission as well, but I found myself too many. I had to cut some, so I moved that one out.

![00:03:32.000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=212)	So today, we'll only be talking about epidemiology and the ecology.

![00:03:36.080](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=216)	Hopefully, you will be interested in these topics. So this is during the work with Dr.

![00:03:43.280](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=223)	Yichun Fang and Wenqiang Shi at Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, as well as Dr.

![00:03:50.800](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=230)	Anna Zhang at Shandong University. Anna was a business student in my lab at UF.

![00:03:57.360](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=237)	That's when she was leading this project, part of this project.

![00:04:03.920](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=243)	Please feel free to stop me anytime if you have any questions.

![00:04:07.360](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=247)	So some background about the disease and the pathogen as well.

![00:04:13.040](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=253)	You're probably quite familiar with this disease because of the pandemic of SARS-CoV-2.

![00:04:19.120](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=259)	MERS is a respiratory infection disease first found in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

![00:04:27.200](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=267)	As of January this year, there were a total of 27 countries that have reported about 2,600

![00:04:36.640](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=276)	lab-confirmed cases, together with 935 deaths. So that's a pretty good number.

![00:04:45.840](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=285)	That has reported about 2,600 lab-confirmed cases, together with 935 deaths. So that's a

![00:04:56.240](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=296)	pretty high case fatality rate. We use the CMR of about 36%.

![00:05:03.440](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=303)	Luckily, human-to-human transmission is pretty rare, and many occurred in healthcare settings

![00:05:09.440](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=309)	and households. And in healthcare settings, it's pretty much patients who are immune-compromised.

![00:05:17.360](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=317)	So that's why they are at high risk of transmission.

![00:05:22.160](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=322)	And the zoonotic infection is mainly driven by exposure to the dummy debris,

![00:05:27.920](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=327)	wire droplets, fomites, and consumption of some raw products of this animal, such as milk.

![00:05:36.320](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=336)	And people also suspect the use of chemical urine as a traditional medicine is another

![00:05:41.280](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=341)	transmission route. And given that there has been no effective treatment or vaccine yet,

![00:05:51.280](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=351)	so people are very concerned about the potential of this virus causing another global pandemic

![00:05:56.880](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=356)	if it's fully adapted itself to the human population. And in 2018, WHO incorporated MERS

![00:06:04.720](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=364)	into its research and development blueprint, which lists a variety of disease pathogens

![00:06:12.480](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=372)	that people will spend more time developing vaccines toward those pathogens.

![00:06:25.280](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=385)	And about the virus itself, it's an RNA virus with a genome about 30 kb long.

![00:06:35.520](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=395)	And MERS-CoV belongs to the lineage C of the genus beta coronavirus. The famous or infamous

![00:06:46.480](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=406)	SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, they belong to the lineage B. And the common code coronaviruses,

![00:06:53.440](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=413)	OC43 and HKU1, they belong to the lineage K. So they're related, but a little bit distant

![00:07:00.800](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=420)	from each other. MERS-CoV was phylogenetically classified into clade A and clade B. A includes

![00:07:10.960](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=430)	the early detected human cases, viruses, and B includes the more contemporary viruses.

![00:07:17.920](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=437)	But however, this classification was based on a pretty few number of sequences. So we've done

![00:07:25.440](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=445)	a much more comprehensive work on this, and we'll show that later.

![00:07:32.960](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=452)	Although the disease was quite new, but circulation of MERS-like coronaviruses

![00:07:43.280](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=463)	in Africa and the Arabian Peninsula occurred well before 2012.

![00:07:51.040](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=471)	And a little bit about the immunity background of this virus. The virus used the S1 protein

![00:07:58.640](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=478)	to bind to two types of host cell surface molecules. One is called the DPP4, and the other

![00:08:07.360](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=487)	is the well-known alpha-2 or alpha-3 astatic acids. And it replicates mainly in the nasal

![00:08:15.840](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=495)	epithelium of dromedaries, but only in the lower respiratory tract of humans. So that's probably

![00:08:25.680](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=505)	why it's so highly transmissible among the dromedaries, but not so much among human beings.

![00:08:36.320](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=516)	All right, so that's enough for the background. Let me get into the needs.

![00:08:40.800](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=520)	We'll try to identify determinants for case fatality rate and also characterize the spatial

![00:08:48.480](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=528)	division pattern of the disease. And we want to also look at evolution and migration history

![00:08:54.480](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=534)	of the virus. Finally, we'll provide some more comprehensive picture about the ecology of the

![00:09:01.840](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=541)	virus. And we'll also look at the evolution and migration history of the virus, and we'll also

![00:09:08.000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=548)	picture about the ecology of the virus and associated socio-environmental drivers.

![00:09:14.960](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=554)	But this talk has two parts. The first two are part one, and this is part two.

![00:09:30.720](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=570)	So in this slide, I talk about the data sources.

![00:09:34.960](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=574)	We first collected data on all confirmed human cases, and there are three major sources for that.

![00:09:43.040](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=583)	We looked at the official reports of WHO. Now, WHO does not provide the line list it used to.

![00:09:52.080](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=592)	So we were lucky. At that time, we got a line list. And the Food and Agriculture Organization

![00:09:59.680](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=599)	of the United Nations, as well as the health departments of affected countries.

![00:10:07.600](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=607)	So we collected demographic data whenever it's available, and the dates of

![00:10:15.600](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=615)	critical events, like the onset, hospitalization, and the lab confirmation.

![00:10:23.360](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=623)	The most important one is to explore your history, but it's very simple. It's just whether

![00:10:28.160](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=628)	the case has had a history of exposure to animal production or other confirmed patient.

![00:10:39.600](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=639)	And we validate this data via literature research. We also collected a bunch of socio-environmental

![00:10:48.960](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=648)	variables, which are listed here, and we'll utilize them, especially using, for example,

![00:10:56.480](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=656)	meteorological data and land cover data for ecology study. The gene sequence data were

![00:11:04.720](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=664)	downloaded from our gene bank, and we used data up to the June of 2020, and that's also

![00:11:13.280](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=673)	the time upper limit for the case data we downloaded.

![00:11:27.360](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=687)	This is an epidemic curve actually provided in the WHO report, and it only listed cases

![00:11:34.240](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=694)	in the eastern Mediterranean region. It's not for the whole world, but because we want to

![00:11:43.200](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=703)	check the seasonality, so we decided to focus on the endemic in the zoonotic region instead of the

![00:11:51.520](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=711)	local region. And it covers from June 2012 to January 2023. This is more comprehensive than

![00:12:00.640](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=720)	the data that we used. We used up to June of 2020, but luckily there weren't many cases after that.

![00:12:09.920](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=729)	I mentioned it was first discovered in September 2012, but you can see here,

![00:12:15.040](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=735)	actually the earliest case shown here can be traced back to early

![00:12:18.960](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=738)	2012, so there could be some cases retrospectively identified.

![00:12:25.360](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=745)	All right. Majority of these cases from Saudi Arabia. That's understandable. Everyone knows that.

![00:12:32.640](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=752)	And we see a huge peak in 2014 and some subsequent large outbreaks in 2015.

![00:12:41.520](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=761)	And you can also see there were about two peaks per year and sometimes three peaks

![00:12:49.440](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=769)	right. One in the early spring and the other one probably in the late summer or early fall.

![00:12:59.600](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=779)	And the early ones in the spring, it's more like an animal exposure in a triggered spinoma.

![00:13:08.000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=788)	So here is a summary table of the kind of baseline characteristics of all the

![00:13:22.960](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=802)	worst cases we included in our study covering this period.

![00:13:27.760](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=807)	Right. And I colored some of these interesting results.

![00:13:37.200](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=817)	In Saudi Arabia, it has far more number of cases as well as number of deaths

![00:13:43.120](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=823)	compared to other countries. And if you look at the CFR, it's also much higher than other regions.

![00:13:50.720](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=830)	In South Korea, I should say South Korea, sorry for that,

![00:13:55.840](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=835)	the number of female patients were much higher than other countries.

![00:14:07.040](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=847)	That's possibly due to, because in Korea, if you know the history of MERS,

![00:14:11.840](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=851)	there was a big outbreak in, if I remember correctly, it was in 2015.

![00:14:18.000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=858)	It's kind of driven by one single imported case. And that patient kind of stimulated large outbreaks

![00:14:26.400](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=866)	in several hospitals. So it's purely kind of a person-to-person transmission. And in that case,

![00:14:33.040](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=873)	it doesn't really distinguish between different sexes, right? But for animal exposure, we'll see

![00:14:39.440](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=879)	later, most of the patients with animal exposure are men. And so that will make some difference.

![00:14:48.720](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=888)	And in these countries, KSA, UAE, and some other countries, the majority of patients are male.

![00:14:59.600](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=899)	And South Korea also has a very large percent of hospital-related

![00:15:06.720](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=906)	patients. And that's exactly because we only had hospital outbreaks in that country.

![00:15:14.480](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=914)	And the time from disease onset to diagnosis was shortest in South Korea. And that's also

![00:15:22.320](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=922)	understandable because those were hospital-triggered investigations. They are very efficient, right?

![00:15:28.240](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=928)	In the United Arab Emirates, we noticed that the age was, the patients were much younger

![00:15:41.600](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=941)	compared to other countries. And that is probably because of the high proportion of healthcare

![00:15:47.920](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=947)	workers compared to other countries. And this country also has the highest proportion of

![00:15:55.040](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=955)	asymptomatic infection. How you identify asymptomatic infection is a very tricky question.

![00:16:06.960](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=966)	Usually, for syndrome-based surveillance, you only can find symptomatic cases. Because of

![00:16:16.800](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=976)	this high proportion of healthcare workers, probably they did some regular monitoring

![00:16:22.720](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=982)	for infection status. And that's how they identified asymptomatic infections.

![00:16:29.840](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=989)	And this country also has a very long time from disease onset to death. The reason for that

![00:16:36.640](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=996)	is unknown, but probably related to the management of patient or facility in the hospitals.

![00:16:48.720](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1008)	So that's for the summary table. Any questions?

![00:16:53.440](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1013)	Okay. So that's the basic epidemiology. Let's go to more interesting materials.

![00:17:02.960](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1022)	In this table, we compare the characteristics between cases with animal contact and those without.

![00:17:12.240](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1032)	About one-fourth of patients were reported animal contact.

![00:17:20.800](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1040)	So we can see patients with animal contact were much less likely to be female

![00:17:28.720](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1048)	compared to this proportion. And they were older. And the case fatality rate was much higher.

![00:17:41.840](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1061)	But we need to be very careful for interpreting this much higher case fatality rate. Because

![00:17:48.400](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1068)	this animal contact, we'll see later, it's confounded with other factors like age,

![00:17:53.680](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1073)	like baseline chronic conditions. If we really want to assess animal contact

![00:18:01.600](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1081)	effect on case fatality rate, we need to adjust for those confounders.

![00:18:06.800](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1086)	It's also less likely to be asymptomatic. But that, again, is a question mark. That probably

![00:18:15.120](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1095)	does not give you any epidemiological... It doesn't describe epidemiology in that regard

![00:18:26.400](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1106)	faithfully. Because for people with animal contact, many of them probably asymptomatic,

![00:18:32.480](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1112)	asymptomatic, and they were not captured by this learning system.

![00:18:38.640](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1118)	And they had much higher proportion of underlying conditions, as I mentioned before.

![00:18:44.480](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1124)	So they're probably at higher risk to death. And they generally had a much longer time from

![00:18:50.240](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1130)	the disease onset to diagnosis. So we'll find later. So that will also probably increase the

![00:18:57.120](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1137)	fatality rate. But for some reason, a slightly longer time from disease onset to death,

![00:19:05.280](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1145)	which we don't quite understand, probably related to some immunology issues.

![00:19:13.120](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1153)	If we look at the proportion of animal contact, a patient with animal contact,

![00:19:18.560](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1158)	across the years, now these proportions are the low proportions.

![00:19:22.720](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1162)	Even though we had fewer and fewer cases over the years, we actually see a different story

![00:19:29.360](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1169)	for this proportion of animal contact. It increases up to 2018, and then they kind of

![00:19:35.440](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1175)	plateaued. And it's not decreasing yet. I'm not sure about the most recent years.

![00:19:40.400](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1180)	The data is not available yet.

![00:19:56.240](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1196)	So this figure shows the spatial distribution of human MERS cases in the whole globe.

![00:20:04.080](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1204)	We categorize the countries into four categories. The first two categories

![00:20:13.760](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1213)	corresponds to the colors of, I would say, maybe I can call that pink, and a little bit of purple.

![00:20:24.080](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1224)	Those countries had zoonotic transmissions, basically animal exposure. The pink ones

![00:20:33.040](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1233)	reported a human-to-human transmission, and the purple one did not report,

![00:20:39.200](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1239)	or at least did not find concrete evidence for human-to-human transmission.

![00:20:44.880](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1244)	And if you look at this map, only Kuwait is the country colored with purple.

![00:20:51.520](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1251)	And it doesn't really mean it did not have human-to-human transmission. I'll explain why.

![00:20:57.600](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1257)	The other two categories are the countries with many important infections,

![00:21:03.760](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1263)	so they're colored with yellow or brown. The yellow indicates there was human-to-human

![00:21:11.280](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1271)	transmission following the importation. And the brown ones, I believe,

![00:21:20.480](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1280)	are the ones without subsequent human-to-human. Oh no, sorry, it's reversed. The yellow ones,

![00:21:26.480](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1286)	did not have human-to-human transmission, but the brown ones had this type of incidence.

![00:21:34.720](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1294)	All right, and for each country with reported cases, we impose a bar chart like this,

![00:21:42.320](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1302)	and the size of the bar indicates number of cases, and then the colors indicate

![00:21:49.280](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1309)	animal contact history. The red indicates the proportion of patients with animal contact.

![00:21:56.160](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1316)	And if you look at Kuwait, it's basically red and green. Green simply means unknown,

![00:22:05.200](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1325)	right? So whether there were human-to-human transmission, we don't know, just not confirmed.

![00:22:13.200](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1333)	And interestingly, Qatar is the country with the highest proportion of animal contact,

![00:22:20.160](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1340)	followed by ASA, UAE, and Oman. Some small countries like these,

![00:22:31.520](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1351)	Bahrain has too few cases, so I wouldn't make any conclusion for that.

![00:22:38.560](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1358)	Some European countries also reported patients with animal contact, as well as here in Southeast

![00:22:58.000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1378)	Asia. But these people most likely already had animal contact before they entered

![00:23:08.560](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1388)	those countries. So to look at what factors contributed to the risk of death,

![00:23:20.320](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1400)	so we performed a standard logistic regression. For all the variables that we have that we think

![00:23:30.480](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1410)	are related, we throw them into the model, we perform the univariable analysis and the

![00:23:35.200](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1415)	multivariable analysis, and all these factors we throw in are significant in both univariable and

![00:23:41.840](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1421)	multivariable analysis. These are strong predictors for case fatality. Let's just go ahead with the

![00:23:51.840](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1431)	multivariable analysis. Don't look at the age, sex, and animal contact yet, because we have

![00:24:03.280](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1443)	interaction terms in the model. And these numbers, like this high number, 10.52, does not represent a

![00:24:11.120](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1451)	marginal effect of age group. It does not. It's just specific to one particular subgroup, and I'll talk

![00:24:16.560](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1456)	about that later. So let's just look at the effects of, say, a healthcare worker, as much lower risk

![00:24:25.520](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1465)	of death. And underlying condition, well, that's a more than three-fold increase in the risk of death.

![00:24:37.520](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1477)	OTC stands for the time from onset to confirmation, it's basically diagnosis, right? Then

![00:24:46.560](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1486)	this has also a significant result. A longer time from onset to confirmation

![00:24:55.200](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1495)	increases the risk of death. And if we compare the years, we divide the time into three segments,

![00:25:02.800](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1502)	and this early phase, this middle phase with large outbreaks, and this later phase with very few cases.

![00:25:09.440](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1509)	And all compared to the early years, we can see a jump in the risk of death. That's probably,

![00:25:17.360](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1517)	at least partly due to the constrained, exhausted healthcare facilities, because the large number

![00:25:24.160](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1524)	of patients. And in the later years, we see a slightly decrease in the risk of death,

![00:25:31.280](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1531)	possibly related to improved patient management, and also the much fewer number of patients.

![00:25:41.440](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1541)	So we left out the most three interesting factors, age, sex, and animal contact. So let's get into those.

![00:25:50.640](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1550)	In this table, we look at age effect, conditioning on sex and animal contact.

![00:26:02.640](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1562)	Let's focus on the adjusted odd ratio directly. These are all pretty big numbers,

![00:26:11.600](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1571)	these are all pretty big numbers, all significant. But let's do some comparison.

![00:26:19.760](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1579)	Let's first compare the results between female and male, right?

![00:26:29.120](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1589)	But you have to condition on the same contact history, right? So with contact history, with

![00:26:33.760](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1593)	animal contact history, if you compare female with male, and then without contact history, female with

![00:26:49.120](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1609)	female with male, right? Without actually comparing this guy, this guy with that guy.

![00:26:54.560](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1614)	So basically, this is bigger than that, and this is bigger than that. So within females,

![00:27:02.080](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1622)	age effect is more prominent, regardless of animal contact history.

![00:27:10.880](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1630)	Age effect is basically comparing the older age to the younger age.

![00:27:18.480](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1638)	And this number shows in the previous table, it's just for this particular subset of population.

![00:27:24.880](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1644)	So age is the most prominent driver for the risk of death. And that's not affected by

![00:27:35.440](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1655)	by either sex or, no, it is affected by sex, right? In female, it's more prominent.

![00:27:43.680](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1663)	And it's not that affected, it is also affected by animal contact. Let's compare the animal contact history.

![00:27:50.240](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1670)	So if you look at, just compare with to without, with to without, and with to without,

![00:28:04.400](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1684)	you can see without animal contact, age effect is more prominent, regardless of the underlying sex.

![00:28:12.160](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1692)	So that's quite interesting. Why is that? Why is that?

![00:28:23.120](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1703)	Remember, males, many of them were actually farm workers, they had animal exposure. So

![00:28:33.280](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1713)	we can reasonably speculate that these patients were constantly challenged by the virus.

![00:28:42.960](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1722)	Okay, probably that's a buildup of immunity towards this virus.

![00:28:50.080](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1730)	So after adjusting for the underlying conditions, and adjusted for the

![00:29:00.560](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1740)	yeah, adjusted for underlying conditions and some other risk factors,

![00:29:04.960](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1744)	we can see the difference in the age group between people with, without animal contact.

![00:29:14.320](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1754)	With animal contact, the age effect is not that prominent, but without, it is very prominent.

![00:29:23.040](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1763)	And most of the animal workers, they were older than younger. So that's for age effect.

![00:29:32.480](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1772)	Let's look at the effect of gender.

![00:29:45.440](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1785)	We don't see many strong signals. The only statistically significant result is within

![00:29:54.160](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1794)	the subgroup of male, the older patients without animal contact.

![00:30:04.000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1804)	And male has a much higher risk of death than female.

![00:30:10.560](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1810)	However, we also noticed that this effect is, you know, has some kind of a marginal signal here.

![00:30:19.600](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1819)	And it is in the opposite direction compared to what we see here.

![00:30:23.600](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1823)	And this subgroup is for the younger, no, for the older patients with animal contact.

![00:30:34.320](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1834)	So that's, that's also quite interesting. For younger patients without animal contact,

![00:30:40.000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1840)	male has much higher risk of death. But within older patients with animal contact,

![00:30:46.560](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1846)	male has actually lower risk of death.

![00:30:55.520](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1855)	And that again, give us a difficult question to answer, why is that?

![00:31:00.880](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1860)	However, we should also notice that within the category of older patients with animal contact

![00:31:08.800](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1868)	and female, we have small number. So that's why this is not statistically significant.

![00:31:16.160](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1876)	So that could be just due to random noise. So maybe we should not over-interpret this 0.45.

![00:31:27.680](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1887)	You actually use a mouse because I don't think, and this is my laser point, that means online.

![00:31:35.840](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1895)	You cannot see that? You actually use mouse.

![00:31:38.320](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1898)	Yeah, let me use mouse. I apologize to the online audience.

![00:31:48.240](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1908)	All right, now finally, let's look at the effect of animal contact conditioning on sex and age group.

![00:31:56.640](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1916)	Now, here, let's just focus on the significant results. The most significant result is this guy.

![00:32:11.120](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1931)	That's ignored, unknown category, just to focus on what we've done.

![00:32:16.960](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1936)	Right, so within the subgroup of female patients and younger female patients,

![00:32:24.080](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1944)	we see a huge increased risk of death for patients with animal contact.

![00:32:35.200](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1955)	Remember, these are female patients. Most animal workers were males.

![00:32:42.240](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1962)	So females, if they had animal contact, it's probably more likely to be a vocational contact,

![00:32:52.080](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1972)	not a professional contact. So that means you may not have to build up immunity against this virus.

![00:33:00.880](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1980)	Right, so once you had contact with animal and got infected, then it's probably a high risk of

![00:33:07.600](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1987)	death. And this virus just jumped from animal to human, has not been adapted much to the human

![00:33:15.520](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=1995)	immune system. But if you look at the subgroup of male patients, the older male patients,

![00:33:24.160](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2004)	if you look at with, without animal contact, you see a huge reduction in the risk of death.

![00:33:30.160](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2010)	And most of these male patients with animal contact, especially the older ones,

![00:33:35.440](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2015)	they were actually animal workers. They had probably long exposure to the virus.

![00:33:50.080](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2030)	Any questions? A lot of information here, difficult to digest in such a short time.

![00:33:59.920](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2039)	Oh, I already see people have put in chat. Okay, let's move on. So those were for the

![00:34:20.560](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2060)	risk factors for death. Now let's look at the spatial diffusion pattern.

![00:34:30.080](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2070)	So what we did here is we look at the time from the first case overall to the first case

![00:34:42.160](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2082)	in each local district. That's the first time the local district was invaded by this virus.

![00:34:50.560](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2090)	With this time as my outcome, I did some, you know, spatial smoothing to construct this contour

![00:35:00.320](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2100)	plot. And this contour plot can tell me the diffusion pattern. And the wider gap between the

![00:35:14.720](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2114)	two contours indicates, let me put it this way, because the gap between each contour plot is

![00:35:31.680](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2131)	kind of fixed for the time interval, 200 days. And a wider gap means a longer spatial distance.

![00:35:41.120](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2141)	So that means a faster spread, right? The first case, first case was here in a city

![00:35:54.320](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2154)	called Bisho, somewhere in south, in western KSA. And this star marks the first patient that

![00:36:04.800](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2164)	sparked a outbreak, human patient cluster. So this Bisho is kind of in the central

![00:36:16.240](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2176)	point of these contour plots. And in the more recent times, we can see actually faster spreading

![00:36:26.000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2186)	and the direction was towards Oman and somewhere of UAE.

![00:36:36.560](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2196)	Right. But that's a characteristic of this plot. We did not show the uncertainty, right?

![00:36:44.560](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2204)	So probably here you have fewer data, then uncertainty could be high. And whether the

![00:36:52.160](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2212)	conclusion that they have fastest spreading, maybe just a noise. But however, if you look

![00:36:59.200](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2219)	at this figure, this map here, let me use mouse again. If you look at the map in the right panel,

![00:37:07.920](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2227)	you can see in this corner, we still have a bunch of cases. So those cases will inform

![00:37:14.880](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2234)	the construction of this contour plot. So the signal here in this corner should be reliable.

![00:37:23.120](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2243)	Right. And you can also notice that we overlay this map with the transportation network.

![00:37:31.440](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2251)	The white, black lines indicate railway and these gray lines indicate the major roads.

![00:37:42.000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2262)	And you can see a pretty good overlap of the cases with this transportation network.

![00:37:48.080](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2268)	And that's what we're going to show in another model fitting.

![00:37:59.520](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2279)	So here we perform the survival analysis. Again, the outcome is a time from the first

![00:38:06.560](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2286)	ever reported worst case to the first importation of case into each district.

![00:38:17.200](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2297)	The so-called district here, it is a second level administrative unit in most countries,

![00:38:25.680](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2305)	except for KSA. Because KSA is relatively big. So in case A, we use county, which is a third level

![00:38:33.200](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2313)	administrative area. And we fit this survival model, trying to look at, this is not an

![00:38:42.240](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2322)	ecological model. It's just to try to look at what might have contributed to

![00:38:47.360](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2327)	the invasion of the virus into these different spatial units. Right. Again,

![00:38:52.400](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2332)	that's just a look at the multivariable analysis. And here we are estimating hazard ratio.

![00:39:03.040](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2343)	The most prominent hazard ratio is related to the intersection with the main road.

![00:39:09.760](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2349)	So after that, it was elevation, the higher elevation, the higher hazard ratio.

![00:39:21.520](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2361)	And also intersection with railway, it more than doubled the hazard of invasion.

![00:39:30.080](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2370)	And interestingly, the coverage of cropland, it seems to deter the spread, which is also

![00:39:37.040](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2377)	understandable. These bio variables, they are meteorological variables. And I listed the

![00:39:53.600](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2393)	interpretations here. Bio one is simply the annual average temperature. And the bio two is the

![00:40:01.040](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2401)	average diurnal range of temperature, which is simply is kind of the average.

![00:40:08.160](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2408)	The difference between the maximum temperature and a minimum temperature within each month,

![00:40:13.040](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2413)	then you take an average. It reflects the variation over time, but within each month.

![00:40:22.080](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2422)	So these two had shown some significant results, increasing the higher temperature or the higher

![00:40:30.400](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2430)	mortality, increase the hazard of invasion.

![00:40:45.280](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2445)	Finally, comes down to the something that may be interesting.

![00:40:49.840](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2449)	So we collected the whole genome sequence from GenBank. And we analyzed these sequences using

![00:40:59.120](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2459)	the toolkits provided by Nextstrain. The sequences were aligned using MAFFT, what do you call it?

![00:41:09.760](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2469)	MAFFT? MAFFT. And the alignment was trained to a reference genome in GenBank. And we constructed

![00:41:24.080](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2484)	the phylogenetic tree using the maximum likelihood approach implemented in the IQ tree software.

![00:41:33.200](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2493)	And for the final geographic analysis, we use the tree time to estimate, you know,

![00:41:42.320](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2502)	the location and host time of those internal nerves. And initial analysis shown on the left

![00:41:50.880](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2510)	panel suggested that

![00:41:56.480](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2516)	the sequences from bats, I think by these pink leaf nodes, and hedgehog,

![00:42:05.680](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2525)	not by the yellow leaf nodes, they separated kind of distant from the main clades of sequences

![00:42:14.640](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2534)	formed by humans and camels, as well as a single strain from a llama, I think, the animal.

![00:42:25.200](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2545)	It is hiding here.

![00:42:32.880](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2552)	And we, so then we just exclude all the sequences of bats and hedgehogs and only focus on the

![00:42:44.960](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2564)	human and the camel genes.

![00:42:54.160](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2574)	So on the right hand panel, you can see we had several clusters for human and camel genes.

![00:43:01.760](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2581)	We have five clusters. The largest cluster is called C5, which contains majority of the sequences.

![00:43:11.280](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2591)	And you can see the mixture of human and camel sequences throughout the tree, except for the

![00:43:20.480](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2600)	most recent ones, where I think this was more like a sampling using, rather than a

![00:43:29.920](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2609)	systematic pattern. So this mixture of human-camel sequences

![00:43:38.320](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2618)	suggests that there were probably constant importation of sphere number from camel to human.

![00:43:54.000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2634)	Now, this figure shows the phylogeny in a much better way because we can we can

![00:44:00.400](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2640)	time here, right? So although the human and camel sequences are mixed together,

![00:44:09.040](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2649)	but if you look at the samples collected after 2016,

![00:44:15.520](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2655)	the human genes are quite distant from the camel genes, right?

![00:44:22.080](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2662)	And the common ancestor was dated around 2007, and the posterior probability for the host being

![00:44:31.520](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2671)	camel, human, kind of 50-50. We later did a sensitivity analysis. We downsampled the human

![00:44:38.320](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2678)	sequences because there's just too many of them. And then the camel will have a 99%

![00:44:45.040](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2685)	for the posterior probability being the common ancestor.

![00:44:55.920](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2695)	We also tried to associate case fatality rate with sequences.

![00:45:00.240](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2700)	So what we did is we look at, we kind of divide the spatial temporal

![00:45:07.760](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2707)	range into several chunks and calculate the case fatality rate within each chunk.

![00:45:13.760](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2713)	And then we look at the individual sequences and associate them with the case fatality rate

![00:45:21.680](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2721)	in that chunk, the location and the time. And then we, for each sequence, we have a bar

![00:45:31.600](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2731)	with a color indicating the underlying case fatality rate in that space time chunk.

![00:45:38.160](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2738)	And then we average for each cluster to compare the potential difference in case fatality rate

![00:45:46.240](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2746)	between clusters. If you compare C5 to other clusters, C1 to C4, you cannot really see much

![00:45:57.040](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2757)	difference between the two. Actually, there's only 1% difference in case fatality rate there,

![00:46:03.280](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2763)	only 1%. But it is significant, probably because of the sample size, but we cannot

![00:46:09.920](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2769)	fully interpret that. If you compare only the sub-clade C5.1 with C1 to C4, we actually see

![00:46:20.960](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2780)	a 4% difference, which is not true. So that means the more recent clade is probably more lethal.

![00:46:34.240](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2794)	We also associated the incidence rate with sequences, but we cannot see much signal there,

![00:46:42.560](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2802)	so I'm going to ignore that. Oh, there's another thing I want to share. Okay, so we,

![00:46:57.280](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2817)	remember, we performed some phylogeographic analysis. So let's take a look at a movie.

![00:47:03.360](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2823)	Hopefully, this movie will show. Let's see.

![00:47:12.800](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2832)	Just a copy-paste.

![00:47:14.160](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2834)	Oh, we're not. We should go back to the window mode, and just copy-paste this one.

![00:47:44.160](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2864)	Let's see if we can do it.

![00:47:51.520](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2871)	Let's see if it works or not.

![00:48:17.840](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2897)	Oh, I have to move it to...

![00:48:39.440](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2919)	Oh, I have to stop sharing.

![00:48:42.320](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2922)	Oh, I see, I see. Yeah, okay.

![00:48:53.600](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2933)	Let me click on it here.

![00:48:59.600](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2939)	I want to see that geographic location.

![00:49:18.240](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2958)	I'm scrolling down, maybe.

![00:49:20.320](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2960)	Scrolling down.

![00:49:25.920](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2965)	All right, yes, and then replay.

![00:49:31.280](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2971)	I'm sorry for this problem, but it's kind of out of my control.

![00:49:39.040](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2979)	Where is play?

![00:49:40.000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2980)	Just click play.

![00:49:41.440](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2981)	Okay, yeah, now let's take a look.

![00:49:46.400](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=2986)	Yeah, it's almost finished. All right, good.

![00:50:11.360](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3011)	Good, okay.

![00:50:16.080](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3016)	Now, let me... Oh, still, that's correct to share a screen, right?

![00:50:26.720](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3026)	Right, okay.

![00:50:29.840](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3029)	Now, some highlights for that movie, right?

![00:50:33.600](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3033)	The top three most likely locations for the common access route were three cities, Riyadh of KSA and now Delta region, which is in Egypt and Jordan.

![00:50:55.360](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3055)	The possibilities are 31%, 17% and 12% respectively.

![00:51:03.040](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3063)	And Riyadh appears to be the major source of exporting infections, both locally and internationally.

![00:51:12.960](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3072)	And it is the common ancestor node of subclades C3, C4 and C5 for 99% of time.

![00:51:25.600](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3085)	Okay, and the early exportation to Egypt and Jordan occurred well before 2010.

![00:51:35.680](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3095)	And the circulation of the MERS-CoV among camels in East Africa possibly started also before 2010.

![00:51:45.040](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3105)	The virus migrated from Egypt to Ethiopia during 2011-2013, and subsequently to Kenya during 2014-2017.

![00:51:57.840](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3117)	And that's partially supported by a zoological study conducted in Egypt in 2013, where they also sampled animals from Kenya and found nothing.

![00:52:09.520](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3129)	The intense migration from Riyadh towards local cities in KSA, as well as Abu Dhabi in UAE, started around the 1970s, which matches our knowledge.

![00:52:26.800](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3146)	And Abu Dhabi joined Riyadh as the second home for exporting the virus, both locally and internationally. So that's quite early.

![00:52:36.160](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3156)	And the model also captures the opportunistic exportation to the US as well as to the US.

![00:52:50.960](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3170)	So we also did some kind of detection of

![00:52:57.840](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3177)	positive selection across proteins and the sites. Remember in the previous slide, see here.

![00:53:11.280](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3191)	Now I'm notating here branch A and branch B. Branch A is kind of separating

![00:53:19.840](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3199)	the hedgehog sequences from the rest, and branch B is separating hedgehog and

![00:53:28.240](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3208)	bat sequences from human and camel sequences. So we performed the

![00:53:35.760](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3215)	positive selection analysis along these two branches.

![00:53:39.760](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3219)	Okay, the first three rows of branch A, we identified three proteins, the non-structural three, nucleoprotein, and this 1AB polyprotein is, I believe, it's from the open reading form 1.

![00:53:58.480](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3238)	I may be wrong, but that's my impression. And we identified the signs

![00:54:04.080](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3244)	with positive selection. Only in this 1AB polyprotein, not in the other two. Along the branch B, we identified these two proteins, including the spike protein.

![00:54:15.120](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3255)	For the branch A, we did not detect the spike protein for any positive selection.

![00:54:22.560](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3262)	And also for the spike protein, we identified these sides to be under high

![00:54:29.280](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3269)	pressure for positive selection. And the three ones marked by red, those are newly found. They did not appear in the literature.

![00:54:44.480](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3284)	And we all know spike protein is the one that most interacts with animal cells.

![00:54:54.080](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3294)	How much time do I have?

![00:54:57.680](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3297)	It's already...

![00:54:58.240](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3298)	Yeah, already 10 seconds.

![00:54:59.680](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3299)	Okay, okay. Then I'll probably ignore the ecology part. For the ecology part, I can just mention some main findings.

![00:55:09.440](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3309)	What we did here is we used several machine learning approaches like post-signal regression tree,

![00:55:18.240](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3318)	supported by commission, and random forest to learn the ecology of the spike protein.

![00:55:27.280](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3327)	And then we build a meta-learner on top of this. It will give us another round of prediction, and it turns out that the ensemble machine, which is a meta-learner,

![00:55:42.880](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3342)	outperforms the three base models. Not by much, but a little bit. If you look at the AUC, if you look at the accuracy, as well as F1 score and compound,

![00:55:59.920](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3359)	not really a good performance in terms of sensitivity, but sensitivity here is a little bit deceptive because we have very few positive cases.

![00:56:24.160](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3384)	This model is based on about 100 positive districts with confirmed cases, and about 400

![00:56:37.360](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3397)	districts without any detection.

![00:56:39.280](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3399)	And we did identify... Let me see. We did identify the most prominent risk driver for ecology of MERS-CoV. It's actually something called the coverage of bare land.

![00:56:52.560](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3412)	Bare land, that's very, very difficult to define. Basically, a land without many, you know, vegetation, trees, like that, right?

![00:57:03.280](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3423)	But we also adjusted for camel density here. Camel density is picked up by the model,

![00:57:09.120](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3429)	but not as a very prominent driver. So we want to control the camel density. Then it's bare land,

![00:57:16.160](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3436)	in addition to camel, it may also contain other animal hosts that we have not discovered yet.

![00:57:30.160](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3450)	Okay, so let me just draw some conclusions on the epithelium model.

![00:57:38.080](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3458)	So we observed that the cases with animal contact

![00:57:42.320](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3462)	tend to be older, more likely to be male, symptomatic, and also having underlying conditions. Even though by our

![00:57:51.440](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3471)	logistic model with interactions, we kind of see that once you adjust your model,

![00:57:57.520](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3477)	underlying conditions, adjusting for age and gender, animal contact actually does not always increase the risk of death.

![00:58:08.160](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3488)	Remember, in the older population, and male, it actually decreases the risk of death.

![00:58:16.240](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3496)	But overall, for those older males who are farm workers, animal workers, because they had underlying conditions, and they were old,

![00:58:20.800](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3500)	overall, they do have a higher risk of death.

![00:58:29.520](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3509)	So we should consider promoting some preventive measures, like an educational campaign or personal protection equipment for those workers.

![00:58:34.320](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3514)	But overall, for those older males who are farm workers, animal workers, because they had underlying conditions, and they were old,

![00:58:42.160](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3522)	overall, they do have a higher risk of death. And we need to pay attention to that.

![00:58:49.360](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3529)	So we should consider promoting some preventive measures, like an educational campaign or personal protection equipment for those workers.

![00:58:57.280](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3537)	And animal-to-human transmission events mainly occurred between January and March,

![00:59:06.800](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3546)	and human-to-human transmission occurred later in summer.

![00:59:11.680](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3551)	So that suggests the importance of blocking the spillover from animal to human in the early spring.

![00:59:18.880](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3558)	And also mentioning, we found sample sequences after 2014, many human sequences, and then camel becomes the host for the root ancestor with a very high possibility.

![00:59:29.920](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3569)	And we also found Abu Dhabi of UAE is a hub for international exportation of this virus.

![00:59:38.000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3578)	So this virus, probably, we should recommend some kind of screening procedure for infected travelers.

![00:59:44.000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3584)	And the novel amino acids positions that we found on spike protein associated with public selection,

![00:59:50.480](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3590)	those can be potential pockets for the spread of this virus.

![00:59:56.640](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3596)	So we should consider promoting some preventive measures, like an educational campaign or personal protection equipment for those workers.

![01:00:02.800](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3602)	And the novel amino acids positions that we found on spike protein associated with public selection,

![01:00:04.800](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3604)	those can be potential pockets for development of future antiviral vaccines against this virus.

![01:00:12.560](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3612)	So that's all for that material.

![01:00:19.760](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3619)	And the NP paper is published in this journal, and the ecology paper is published in this journal.

![01:00:26.240](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3626)	Thank you very much. Any questions, you're welcome.

![01:00:32.640](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3632)	Yes, please. I'm really interested about the phylogeny. Can you go back to the figure four or five?

![01:00:49.520](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3649)	Yeah, that's the one. So, since after 2016, it's really interesting, like, human birds and

![01:01:07.680](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3667)	camels are pretty much distinct. Do you think it's because the sampling bios of the camel,

![01:01:13.760](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3673)	or do you believe there's somehow a low level circulation of human population?

![01:01:21.280](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3681)	That's a good question. I don't have the answer. My intuition is sampling virus is at least a contributing factor.

![01:01:30.480](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3690)	It's hard to imagine, because this virus is endemic in camels. It's hard to imagine it's gone. I don't think it's gone.

![01:01:36.800](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3696)	So, Ryan in the chat would like to know what type of models make up your own sample.

![01:01:45.920](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3705)	Oh, so the base models are a random forest, boosted regression tree, and

![01:01:53.760](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3713)	support vector machine. And then on top of that, the meta-learner is actually XGBoost.

![01:02:00.160](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3720)	Does that answer your question?

![01:02:08.160](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3728)	Yes, thank you.

![01:02:14.880](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3734)	Yes, so it seems like this is a fairly small tree. Why did you end up choosing

![01:02:21.440](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3741)	using the Nextstrain pipeline as opposed to a different tree building pipeline?

![01:02:28.640](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3748)	It was not my decision. My intuition would always try maybe like a beast first.

![01:02:38.880](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3758)	However, I wouldn't say it's a small data set either, because we have, I think, about 500 sequences together.

![01:02:46.320](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3766)	A beast may need some time to run. And another nice thing about the Nextstrain is that it provides

![01:02:53.040](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3773)	all sorts of tools together for you to use, and with this nice movie. So I think that's

![01:03:00.320](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3780)	probably the only reason why we chose Nextstrain. But I think definitely you can try a beast as well,

![01:03:06.880](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3786)	especially for the geographic analysis.

![01:03:12.960](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3792)	Could you tell us more about surveillance or genome sequencing of camel or

![01:03:20.240](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3800)	reservoir species? I think that's really important because it can give us a

![01:03:26.080](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3806)	good background about circulation in these reservoirs and spillover between them.

![01:03:34.080](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3814)	I'm not quite sure whether there is a systematic surveillance system for animals.

![01:03:41.200](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3821)	Actually, in terms of animal hosts, although at least the bats and hedgehogs here

![01:03:51.200](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3831)	if you look into the literature, it's still kind of debatable, right? We all have common sense.

![01:03:57.840](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3837)	Bats is the natural reservoir for all types of coronaviruses, including MERS,

![01:04:04.400](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3844)	MERS-CoV. But as a matter of fact, so far people have only found, to my knowledge,

![01:04:11.280](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3851)	kind of similar gene segments in the virus as in the form of bats.

![01:04:16.720](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3856)	That's not considered some very solid evidence by many of our biologists and immunologists.

![01:04:24.560](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3864)	Yeah, I know less about the hedgehogs, so I cannot say much about that.

![01:04:31.200](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3871)	So the primary animal host that's solidly convincing people is camels,

![01:04:38.240](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3878)	scum, gondolins. And we should do surveillance.

![01:04:45.840](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3885)	I have a question about student training because you're applying for adjunct

![01:04:51.760](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3891)	faculty position here. So what kind, what type of students would you expect working in your lab,

![01:04:57.680](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3897)	or how would you train bioinformatics students? In terms of bioinformatics itself,

![01:05:05.440](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3905)	I need a partner like Dr. Liu. Myself, no, I cannot train you. I'm very interested in this

![01:05:15.040](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3915)	field, but myself, I need to be trained as well. But my vision is that, you know,

![01:05:22.400](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3922)	we don't have this vision. We want to combine biological data, gene sequence data. So far,

![01:05:29.600](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3929)	we're only talking about the pathogen sequence, right? It could be human sequence as well,

![01:05:33.440](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3933)	but that's a long shot. And also like human movement data, all together to inform us about

![01:05:39.760](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3939)	the transmission dynamics. And that's also very important to understand how the virus is going to

![01:05:46.720](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3946)	evolve in terms of its transmissibility, pathogenicity, and so on.

![01:05:54.000](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3954)	So far, there have been some efforts in this kind of joint modeling in the past 10 years, but

![01:06:03.440](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3963)	it's still under investigated. It's still a very promising direction. So anybody with interest in

![01:06:11.440](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3971)	both bioinformatics and statistics and computational methods are welcome to join this effort.

![01:06:24.480](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3984)	Yeah, sure. It says elevation was insignificant in the univariable analysis. Why was it included

![01:06:30.400](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3990)	in the multivariable and into that mix? Good question. Let me check.

![01:06:36.640](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=3996)	Elevation. That's for the survival analysis, is that? Yes.

![01:06:45.920](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=4005)	Yeah.

![01:06:59.600](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=4019)	Oh, this is kind of more like a statistical philosophy question,

![01:07:07.520](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=4027)	right? Because here, we did not explore the potential interactions explicitly.

![01:07:15.440](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=4035)	So there could be interactions among these factors. And in the univariable analysis,

![01:07:22.160](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=4042)	it's not significant. Actually, the p-value is very close to one, but that does not mean

![01:07:28.480](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=4048)	it's not having an interaction. Or it could be a confounder. Because if you look at the

![01:07:34.480](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=4054)	coverage of a bare land with elevation, there is some correlation there.

![01:07:42.720](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=4062)	Right? Not very high, not super high, but there is some substantial correlation there.

![01:07:46.880](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=4066)	So we cannot just rule it out. In the multivariable model, we did not just leave

![01:07:52.240](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=4072)	out those non-significant in the multivariate model. We actually add them back one by one

![01:08:00.320](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=4080)	to check whether they're going to become significant after adjusting for other factors.

![01:08:05.600](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=4085)	So that's the reason.

![01:08:11.120](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=4091)	Thank you. All right. If there's no questions, let's send Professor Gao.

![01:08:29.200](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=4109)	Yeah, I think I set it up. I know I have to clean up, so I won't be there.

![01:08:35.600](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=4115)	All right. I think that's something else.

![01:08:38.960](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=4118)	Yeah. Should I go?

![01:08:41.680](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl8KzTODzQ&t=4121)	You can just show up. I'll show up at the booth, I guess.
