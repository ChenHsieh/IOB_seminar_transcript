The transcripts of spring 2023 IOB seminar auto generated by the OpenAI Whisper large model.

## Description

All the transcripts of IOB Spring seminars as of 4/23 are in the `out` folder.

The scripts used to generate the transcripts are in the `scripts` folder. I first used the `yt_dlp.sh` to download the sound from youtube video into `mp3` format. Then used the `prep_whisper_job.py` to generate commands for each sound file. Finally, I used the generated `cmd.sh` to submit the job to UGA's sapelo2 cluster.
