The transcripts of spring 2023 IOB seminar auto generated by the OpenAI Whisper large model.

## Description

All the transcripts with different file format of IOB Spring seminars as of April 2023 are in the `out` folder of the [github repo](https://github.com/ChenHsieh/IOB_seminar_transcript).

The scripts used to generate the transcripts are in the `scripts` folder. I first used the `yt_dlp.sh` to download the sound from youtube video into `mp3` format. 

```
yt-dlp -x --audio-format mp3 -o '%(title)s.%(ext)s' {youtube link}
```

Then use the `prep_whisper_job.py` to generate commands for each sound file. It would generate `cmd.sh` for me to submit a lot of job to UGA's sapelo2 cluster.

```
whisper --model large -o out -- './{filename}';
```

Finally, I used `prep_jekyll_page.py` to generate the markdown file for each transcript.

## Status

I will update when I want to. Please feel free to use the transcripts for your own purpose or contact me for more interesting project.
