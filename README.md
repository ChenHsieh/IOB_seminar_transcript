The transcripts of spring 2023 seminar of [IOB at UGA](https://www.youtube.com/@InstituteOfBioinformaticsUGA) auto generated by the [OpenAI Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) large model.

## Description

All the transcripts with different file format of IOB Spring seminars as of April 2023 are in the `out` folder of the [github repo](https://github.com/ChenHsieh/IOB_seminar_transcript).

The scripts used to generate the transcripts are in the `scripts` folder. I first used the `yt_dlp.sh` to download youtube videos and convert them into `mp3` format. (ty [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp))

```
yt-dlp -x --audio-format mp3 -o '%(title)s.%(ext)s' {youtube link}
```

Then use the `prep_whisper_job.py` to generate commands for each sound file. It would generate `cmd.sh` for me to submit a lot of job to run [whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) on [UGA's sapelo2 cluster](https://wiki.gacrc.uga.edu/wiki/Running_Jobs_on_Sapelo2#Batch_partitions_.28queues.29_defined_on_the_Sapelo2).

```
whisper --model large -o out -- './{filename}';
```

Finally, I used `prep_jekyll_page.py` to generate the markdown file for each transcript so we can see this github page.

## Status

I will update when I want to. Please feel free to use the transcripts for your own purpose or contact me for more interesting projects.
