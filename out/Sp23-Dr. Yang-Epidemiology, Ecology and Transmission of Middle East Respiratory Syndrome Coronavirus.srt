1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,120
My pleasure to introduce Professor Yang, who joined UGA last semester and as a class chair

2
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:34,960
of ecology, mathematics, and statistics, but he doesn't have any commitment to

3
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:45,120
or ecology. So this seminar also serves for his application for the adjunct position with IOB.

4
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:53,760
So if you're a student and looking for lab, you may want to talk to him. His major research area

5
00:00:53,760 --> 00:01:00,960
is infectious disease, and he is a statistician modeling for infectious disease. As you know,

6
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:08,000
to understand infectious disease, we need the knowledge in ecology, population genetics,

7
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,600
molecular genetics, to understand evolution of pathogens, and mathematics, you know,

8
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:21,520
as well as statistics. So it's very hard to find an expert in all of those areas,

9
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:27,840
and here we go. Professor Yang, so if you're interested in doing research in infectious

10
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:38,160
disease, you probably want to talk to him. He has a lot of grants. He's already published over 100

11
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:46,400
papers, and this is, believe me, this is just the first page of his CV. So I cannot read out

12
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:57,200
all the CVs. It's 19 pages. So he, let's see. Sorry, I'm aging, so I cannot see that. So he

13
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:10,240
got his PhD in 2004 from Emory, and he did his postdoc at Howard, right, so for the following

14
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:20,560
year, and then he worked at Brad Hutchinson Cancer Center, and then he moved to University

15
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:27,600
of Florida, and last semester, he joined again. So today, he's going to talk about epidemiology

16
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:35,520
and ecology of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus.

17
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,480
Okay, good. Thank you, Liang, for this nice introduction and over compliment.

18
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:56,160
I'm not expert in everything, and I mainly specialize in modeling of infectious disease

19
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:03,280
transmission, and just started working with Dr. Liu on how to combine the epidemiological part

20
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:10,000
and the physiological part into the same model so that we can better model the dynamics of

21
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:17,200
transmission. Today, I'm going to talk about epidemiology and the ecology of MERS-CoV.

22
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,560
If you read the flyer before, I changed my title a little bit. I used to have

23
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:31,360
transmission as well, but I found myself too many. I had to cut some, so I moved that one out.

24
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,960
So today, we'll only be talking about epidemiology and the ecology.

25
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:43,280
Hopefully, you will be interested in these topics. So this is during the work with Dr.

26
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:50,720
Yichun Fang and Wenqiang Shi at Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, as well as Dr.

27
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:56,240
Anna Zhang at Shandong University. Anna was a business student in my lab at UF.

28
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,400
That's when she was leading this project, part of this project.

29
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,720
Please feel free to stop me anytime if you have any questions.

30
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,360
So some background about the disease and the pathogen as well.

31
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,120
You're probably quite familiar with this disease because of the pandemic of SARS-CoV-2.

32
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:26,400
MERS is a respiratory infection disease first found in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

33
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:36,640
As of January this year, there were a total of 27 countries that have reported about 2,600

34
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:44,880
lab-confirmed cases, together with 935 deaths. So that's a pretty good number.

35
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:56,240
That has reported about 2,600 lab-confirmed cases, together with 935 deaths. So that's a

36
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,960
pretty high case fatality rate. We use the CMR of about 36%.

37
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:09,440
Luckily, human-to-human transmission is pretty rare, and many occurred in healthcare settings

38
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:17,360
and households. And in healthcare settings, it's pretty much patients who are immune-compromised.

39
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,720
So that's why they are at high risk of transmission.

40
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:27,280
And the zoonotic infection is mainly driven by exposure to the dummy debris,

41
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:35,600
wire droplets, fomites, and consumption of some raw products of this animal, such as milk.

42
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:41,280
And people also suspect the use of chemical urine as a traditional medicine is another

43
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:51,280
transmission route. And given that there has been no effective treatment or vaccine yet,

44
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:56,880
so people are very concerned about the potential of this virus causing another global pandemic

45
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:04,720
if it's fully adapted itself to the human population. And in 2018, WHO incorporated MERS

46
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:12,480
into its research and development blueprint, which lists a variety of disease pathogens

47
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:18,080
that people will spend more time developing vaccines toward those pathogens.

48
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:33,120
And about the virus itself, it's an RNA virus with a genome about 30 kb long.

49
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:46,480
And MERS-CoV belongs to the lineage C of the genus beta coronavirus. The famous or infamous

50
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:53,440
SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, they belong to the lineage B. And the common code coronaviruses,

51
00:06:53,440 --> 00:07:00,800
OC43 and HKU1, they belong to the lineage K. So they're related, but a little bit distant

52
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:10,400
from each other. MERS-CoV was phylogenetically classified into clade A and clade B. A includes

53
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:17,920
the early detected human cases, viruses, and B includes the more contemporary viruses.

54
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:25,440
But however, this classification was based on a pretty few number of sequences. So we've done

55
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,280
a much more comprehensive work on this, and we'll show that later.

56
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:39,600
Although the disease was quite new, but circulation of MERS-like coronaviruses

57
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:50,080
in Africa and the Arabian Peninsula occurred well before 2012.

58
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:58,640
And a little bit about the immunity background of this virus. The virus used the S1 protein

59
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:07,360
to bind to two types of host cell surface molecules. One is called the DPP4, and the other

60
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:15,280
is the well-known alpha-2 or alpha-3 astatic acids. And it replicates mainly in the nasal

61
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:25,680
epithelium of dromedaries, but only in the lower respiratory tract of humans. So that's probably

62
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:33,360
why it's so highly transmissible among the dromedaries, but not so much among human beings.

63
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,480
All right, so that's enough for the background. Let me get into the needs.

64
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:48,480
We'll try to identify determinants for case fatality rate and also characterize the spatial

65
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:54,480
division pattern of the disease. And we want to also look at evolution and migration history

66
00:08:54,480 --> 00:09:01,840
of the virus. Finally, we'll provide some more comprehensive picture about the ecology of the

67
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:08,000
virus. And we'll also look at the evolution and migration history of the virus, and we'll also

68
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,920
picture about the ecology of the virus and associated socio-environmental drivers.

69
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:19,440
But this talk has two parts. The first two are part one, and this is part two.

70
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,160
So in this slide, I talk about the data sources.

71
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:41,760
We first collected data on all confirmed human cases, and there are three major sources for that.

72
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:52,080
We looked at the official reports of WHO. Now, WHO does not provide the line list it used to.

73
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:59,120
So we were lucky. At that time, we got a line list. And the Food and Agriculture Organization

74
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:06,000
of the United Nations, as well as the health departments of affected countries.

75
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:13,680
So we collected demographic data whenever it's available, and the dates of

76
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:22,000
critical events, like the onset, hospitalization, and the lab confirmation.

77
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,160
The most important one is to explore your history, but it's very simple. It's just whether

78
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:38,880
the case has had a history of exposure to animal production or other confirmed patient.

79
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:48,960
And we validate this data via literature research. We also collected a bunch of socio-environmental

80
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:56,480
variables, which are listed here, and we'll utilize them, especially using, for example,

81
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:04,720
meteorological data and land cover data for ecology study. The gene sequence data were

82
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:12,720
downloaded from our gene bank, and we used data up to the June of 2020, and that's also

83
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:18,880
the time upper limit for the case data we downloaded.

84
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:33,360
This is an epidemic curve actually provided in the WHO report, and it only listed cases

85
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:43,200
in the eastern Mediterranean region. It's not for the whole world, but because we want to

86
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:51,520
check the seasonality, so we decided to focus on the endemic in the zoonotic region instead of the

87
00:11:51,520 --> 00:12:00,640
local region. And it covers from June 2012 to January 2023. This is more comprehensive than

88
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:08,000
the data that we used. We used up to June of 2020, but luckily there weren't many cases after that.

89
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:15,040
I mentioned it was first discovered in September 2012, but you can see here,

90
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,960
actually the earliest case shown here can be traced back to early

91
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:23,440
2012, so there could be some cases retrospectively identified.

92
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:31,360
All right. Majority of these cases from Saudi Arabia. That's understandable. Everyone knows that.

93
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:41,520
And we see a huge peak in 2014 and some subsequent large outbreaks in 2015.

94
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:47,680
And you can also see there were about two peaks per year and sometimes three peaks

95
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:58,480
right. One in the early spring and the other one probably in the late summer or early fall.

96
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:08,000
And the early ones in the spring, it's more like an animal exposure in a triggered spinoma.

97
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:22,320
So here is a summary table of the kind of baseline characteristics of all the

98
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:27,040
worst cases we included in our study covering this period.

99
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:34,240
Right. And I colored some of these interesting results.

100
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:43,120
In Saudi Arabia, it has far more number of cases as well as number of deaths

101
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:49,920
compared to other countries. And if you look at the CFR, it's also much higher than other regions.

102
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,240
In South Korea, I should say South Korea, sorry for that,

103
00:13:55,840 --> 00:14:05,280
the number of female patients were much higher than other countries.

104
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:11,840
That's possibly due to, because in Korea, if you know the history of MERS,

105
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:17,040
there was a big outbreak in, if I remember correctly, it was in 2015.

106
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:26,400
It's kind of driven by one single imported case. And that patient kind of stimulated large outbreaks

107
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:32,480
in several hospitals. So it's purely kind of a person-to-person transmission. And in that case,

108
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:38,960
it doesn't really distinguish between different sexes, right? But for animal exposure, we'll see

109
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:47,920
later, most of the patients with animal exposure are men. And so that will make some difference.

110
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:58,720
And in these countries, KSA, UAE, and some other countries, the majority of patients are male.

111
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:05,600
And South Korea also has a very large percent of hospital-related

112
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:12,080
patients. And that's exactly because we only had hospital outbreaks in that country.

113
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:22,320
And the time from disease onset to diagnosis was shortest in South Korea. And that's also

114
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:27,280
understandable because those were hospital-triggered investigations. They are very efficient, right?

115
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:41,600
In the United Arab Emirates, we noticed that the age was, the patients were much younger

116
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:47,920
compared to other countries. And that is probably because of the high proportion of healthcare

117
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:55,040
workers compared to other countries. And this country also has the highest proportion of

118
00:15:55,040 --> 00:16:06,320
asymptomatic infection. How you identify asymptomatic infection is a very tricky question.

119
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:16,800
Usually, for syndrome-based surveillance, you only can find symptomatic cases. Because of

120
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:22,640
this high proportion of healthcare workers, probably they did some regular monitoring

121
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,280
for infection status. And that's how they identified asymptomatic infections.

122
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:36,640
And this country also has a very long time from disease onset to death. The reason for that

123
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:46,080
is unknown, but probably related to the management of patient or facility in the hospitals.

124
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,280
So that's for the summary table. Any questions?

125
00:16:53,440 --> 00:17:01,200
Okay. So that's the basic epidemiology. Let's go to more interesting materials.

126
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:11,360
In this table, we compare the characteristics between cases with animal contact and those without.

127
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:18,880
About one-fourth of patients were reported animal contact.

128
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:27,200
So we can see patients with animal contact were much less likely to be female

129
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:39,920
compared to this proportion. And they were older. And the case fatality rate was much higher.

130
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:48,400
But we need to be very careful for interpreting this much higher case fatality rate. Because

131
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:53,680
this animal contact, we'll see later, it's confounded with other factors like age,

132
00:17:53,680 --> 00:18:00,960
like baseline chronic conditions. If we really want to assess animal contact

133
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,840
effect on case fatality rate, we need to adjust for those confounders.

134
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:15,120
It's also less likely to be asymptomatic. But that, again, is a question mark. That probably

135
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:26,400
does not give you any epidemiological... It doesn't describe epidemiology in that regard

136
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:32,160
faithfully. Because for people with animal contact, many of them probably asymptomatic,

137
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,520
asymptomatic, and they were not captured by this learning system.

138
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:43,280
And they had much higher proportion of underlying conditions, as I mentioned before.

139
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:50,240
So they're probably at higher risk to death. And they generally had a much longer time from

140
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:57,120
the disease onset to diagnosis. So we'll find later. So that will also probably increase the

141
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:05,280
fatality rate. But for some reason, a slightly longer time from disease onset to death,

142
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:12,240
which we don't quite understand, probably related to some immunology issues.

143
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:18,560
If we look at the proportion of animal contact, a patient with animal contact,

144
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:22,160
across the years, now these proportions are the low proportions.

145
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:29,360
Even though we had fewer and fewer cases over the years, we actually see a different story

146
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:35,440
for this proportion of animal contact. It increases up to 2018, and then they kind of

147
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:40,400
plateaued. And it's not decreasing yet. I'm not sure about the most recent years.

148
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,760
The data is not available yet.

149
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:03,680
So this figure shows the spatial distribution of human MERS cases in the whole globe.

150
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:12,640
We categorize the countries into four categories. The first two categories

151
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:23,520
corresponds to the colors of, I would say, maybe I can call that pink, and a little bit of purple.

152
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:32,880
Those countries had zoonotic transmissions, basically animal exposure. The pink ones

153
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:39,200
reported a human-to-human transmission, and the purple one did not report,

154
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:44,240
or at least did not find concrete evidence for human-to-human transmission.

155
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:50,080
And if you look at this map, only Kuwait is the country colored with purple.

156
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:56,640
And it doesn't really mean it did not have human-to-human transmission. I'll explain why.

157
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:03,120
The other two categories are the countries with many important infections,

158
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:11,280
so they're colored with yellow or brown. The yellow indicates there was human-to-human

159
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:18,640
transmission following the importation. And the brown ones, I believe,

160
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:26,160
are the ones without subsequent human-to-human. Oh no, sorry, it's reversed. The yellow ones,

161
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:32,240
did not have human-to-human transmission, but the brown ones had this type of incidence.

162
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:41,680
All right, and for each country with reported cases, we impose a bar chart like this,

163
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:48,160
and the size of the bar indicates number of cases, and then the colors indicate

164
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:55,520
animal contact history. The red indicates the proportion of patients with animal contact.

165
00:21:56,160 --> 00:22:04,400
And if you look at Kuwait, it's basically red and green. Green simply means unknown,

166
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:10,960
right? So whether there were human-to-human transmission, we don't know, just not confirmed.

167
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:19,360
And interestingly, Qatar is the country with the highest proportion of animal contact,

168
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:30,240
followed by ASA, UAE, and Oman. Some small countries like these,

169
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:38,560
Bahrain has too few cases, so I wouldn't make any conclusion for that.

170
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:58,000
Some European countries also reported patients with animal contact, as well as here in Southeast

171
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:08,080
Asia. But these people most likely already had animal contact before they entered

172
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:20,320
those countries. So to look at what factors contributed to the risk of death,

173
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:30,480
so we performed a standard logistic regression. For all the variables that we have that we think

174
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:35,200
are related, we throw them into the model, we perform the univariable analysis and the

175
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:41,840
multivariable analysis, and all these factors we throw in are significant in both univariable and

176
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:51,840
multivariable analysis. These are strong predictors for case fatality. Let's just go ahead with the

177
00:23:51,840 --> 00:24:03,280
multivariable analysis. Don't look at the age, sex, and animal contact yet, because we have

178
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:11,120
interaction terms in the model. And these numbers, like this high number, 10.52, does not represent a

179
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:16,560
marginal effect of age group. It does not. It's just specific to one particular subgroup, and I'll talk

180
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:25,520
about that later. So let's just look at the effects of, say, a healthcare worker, as much lower risk

181
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:35,680
of death. And underlying condition, well, that's a more than three-fold increase in the risk of death.

182
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:46,160
OTC stands for the time from onset to confirmation, it's basically diagnosis, right? Then

183
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:55,200
this has also a significant result. A longer time from onset to confirmation

184
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:02,800
increases the risk of death. And if we compare the years, we divide the time into three segments,

185
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:08,880
and this early phase, this middle phase with large outbreaks, and this later phase with very few cases.

186
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:16,640
And all compared to the early years, we can see a jump in the risk of death. That's probably,

187
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:24,160
at least partly due to the constrained, exhausted healthcare facilities, because the large number

188
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:30,720
of patients. And in the later years, we see a slightly decrease in the risk of death,

189
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:39,600
possibly related to improved patient management, and also the much fewer number of patients.

190
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:50,080
So we left out the most three interesting factors, age, sex, and animal contact. So let's get into those.

191
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:59,440
In this table, we look at age effect, conditioning on sex and animal contact.

192
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:11,040
Let's focus on the adjusted odd ratio directly. These are all pretty big numbers,

193
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:19,120
these are all pretty big numbers, all significant. But let's do some comparison.

194
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:29,120
Let's first compare the results between female and male, right?

195
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:33,760
But you have to condition on the same contact history, right? So with contact history, with

196
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:42,640
animal contact history, if you compare female with male, and then without contact history, female with

197
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:53,680
female with male, right? Without actually comparing this guy, this guy with that guy.

198
00:26:54,560 --> 00:27:01,440
So basically, this is bigger than that, and this is bigger than that. So within females,

199
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:07,440
age effect is more prominent, regardless of animal contact history.

200
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:17,200
Age effect is basically comparing the older age to the younger age.

201
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:24,160
And this number shows in the previous table, it's just for this particular subset of population.

202
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:33,600
So age is the most prominent driver for the risk of death. And that's not affected by

203
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:43,120
by either sex or, no, it is affected by sex, right? In female, it's more prominent.

204
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:50,080
And it's not that affected, it is also affected by animal contact. Let's compare the animal contact history.

205
00:27:50,240 --> 00:28:02,880
So if you look at, just compare with to without, with to without, and with to without,

206
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:12,160
you can see without animal contact, age effect is more prominent, regardless of the underlying sex.

207
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:19,760
So that's quite interesting. Why is that? Why is that?

208
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:31,200
Remember, males, many of them were actually farm workers, they had animal exposure. So

209
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:40,800
we can reasonably speculate that these patients were constantly challenged by the virus.

210
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:48,800
Okay, probably that's a buildup of immunity towards this virus.

211
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:56,640
So after adjusting for the underlying conditions, and adjusted for the

212
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:04,000
yeah, adjusted for underlying conditions and some other risk factors,

213
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:14,320
we can see the difference in the age group between people with, without animal contact.

214
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:20,320
With animal contact, the age effect is not that prominent, but without, it is very prominent.

215
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:32,400
And most of the animal workers, they were older than younger. So that's for age effect.

216
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,480
Let's look at the effect of gender.

217
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:54,160
We don't see many strong signals. The only statistically significant result is within

218
00:29:54,160 --> 00:30:02,240
the subgroup of male, the older patients without animal contact.

219
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
And male has a much higher risk of death than female.

220
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:19,600
However, we also noticed that this effect is, you know, has some kind of a marginal signal here.

221
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:23,600
And it is in the opposite direction compared to what we see here.

222
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:30,080
And this subgroup is for the younger, no, for the older patients with animal contact.

223
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:39,360
So that's, that's also quite interesting. For younger patients without animal contact,

224
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:46,160
male has much higher risk of death. But within older patients with animal contact,

225
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:52,960
male has actually lower risk of death.

226
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:59,680
And that again, give us a difficult question to answer, why is that?

227
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:08,800
However, we should also notice that within the category of older patients with animal contact

228
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:15,200
and female, we have small number. So that's why this is not statistically significant.

229
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:24,480
So that could be just due to random noise. So maybe we should not over-interpret this 0.45.

230
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:34,080
You actually use a mouse because I don't think, and this is my laser point, that means online.

231
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,320
You cannot see that? You actually use mouse.

232
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:45,760
Yeah, let me use mouse. I apologize to the online audience.

233
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:55,680
All right, now finally, let's look at the effect of animal contact conditioning on sex and age group.

234
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:11,120
Now, here, let's just focus on the significant results. The most significant result is this guy.

235
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:16,640
That's ignored, unknown category, just to focus on what we've done.

236
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:23,440
Right, so within the subgroup of female patients and younger female patients,

237
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:33,520
we see a huge increased risk of death for patients with animal contact.

238
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:42,240
Remember, these are female patients. Most animal workers were males.

239
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:52,080
So females, if they had animal contact, it's probably more likely to be a vocational contact,

240
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:59,680
not a professional contact. So that means you may not have to build up immunity against this virus.

241
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:07,600
Right, so once you had contact with animal and got infected, then it's probably a high risk of

242
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:14,960
death. And this virus just jumped from animal to human, has not been adapted much to the human

243
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:23,200
immune system. But if you look at the subgroup of male patients, the older male patients,

244
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:29,920
if you look at with, without animal contact, you see a huge reduction in the risk of death.

245
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:34,720
And most of these male patients with animal contact, especially the older ones,

246
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:43,280
they were actually animal workers. They had probably long exposure to the virus.

247
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:57,280
Any questions? A lot of information here, difficult to digest in such a short time.

248
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:20,000
Oh, I already see people have put in chat. Okay, let's move on. So those were for the

249
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:26,560
risk factors for death. Now let's look at the spatial diffusion pattern.

250
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:42,160
So what we did here is we look at the time from the first case overall to the first case

251
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:49,920
in each local district. That's the first time the local district was invaded by this virus.

252
00:34:50,560 --> 00:35:00,320
With this time as my outcome, I did some, you know, spatial smoothing to construct this contour

253
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:13,760
plot. And this contour plot can tell me the diffusion pattern. And the wider gap between the

254
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:30,880
two contours indicates, let me put it this way, because the gap between each contour plot is

255
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:40,320
kind of fixed for the time interval, 200 days. And a wider gap means a longer spatial distance.

256
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:54,320
So that means a faster spread, right? The first case, first case was here in a city

257
00:35:54,320 --> 00:36:04,800
called Bisho, somewhere in south, in western KSA. And this star marks the first patient that

258
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:14,480
sparked a outbreak, human patient cluster. So this Bisho is kind of in the central

259
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:26,000
point of these contour plots. And in the more recent times, we can see actually faster spreading

260
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:33,600
and the direction was towards Oman and somewhere of UAE.

261
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:44,560
Right. But that's a characteristic of this plot. We did not show the uncertainty, right?

262
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:52,160
So probably here you have fewer data, then uncertainty could be high. And whether the

263
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:59,200
conclusion that they have fastest spreading, maybe just a noise. But however, if you look

264
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:07,200
at this figure, this map here, let me use mouse again. If you look at the map in the right panel,

265
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:14,880
you can see in this corner, we still have a bunch of cases. So those cases will inform

266
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:21,120
the construction of this contour plot. So the signal here in this corner should be reliable.

267
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:30,880
Right. And you can also notice that we overlay this map with the transportation network.

268
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:40,320
The white, black lines indicate railway and these gray lines indicate the major roads.

269
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:48,080
And you can see a pretty good overlap of the cases with this transportation network.

270
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:52,400
And that's what we're going to show in another model fitting.

271
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:06,560
So here we perform the survival analysis. Again, the outcome is a time from the first

272
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:16,640
ever reported worst case to the first importation of case into each district.

273
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:25,680
The so-called district here, it is a second level administrative unit in most countries,

274
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:33,200
except for KSA. Because KSA is relatively big. So in case A, we use county, which is a third level

275
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:42,240
administrative area. And we fit this survival model, trying to look at, this is not an

276
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:46,560
ecological model. It's just to try to look at what might have contributed to

277
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:52,400
the invasion of the virus into these different spatial units. Right. Again,

278
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:58,160
that's just a look at the multivariable analysis. And here we are estimating hazard ratio.

279
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:09,440
The most prominent hazard ratio is related to the intersection with the main road.

280
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:20,320
So after that, it was elevation, the higher elevation, the higher hazard ratio.

281
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:28,000
And also intersection with railway, it more than doubled the hazard of invasion.

282
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:37,040
And interestingly, the coverage of cropland, it seems to deter the spread, which is also

283
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:53,600
understandable. These bio variables, they are meteorological variables. And I listed the

284
00:39:53,600 --> 00:40:01,040
interpretations here. Bio one is simply the annual average temperature. And the bio two is the

285
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:05,760
average diurnal range of temperature, which is simply is kind of the average.

286
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:13,040
The difference between the maximum temperature and a minimum temperature within each month,

287
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:21,440
then you take an average. It reflects the variation over time, but within each month.

288
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:29,600
So these two had shown some significant results, increasing the higher temperature or the higher

289
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:34,480
mortality, increase the hazard of invasion.

290
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:49,360
Finally, comes down to the something that may be interesting.

291
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:59,120
So we collected the whole genome sequence from GenBank. And we analyzed these sequences using

292
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:08,960
the toolkits provided by Nextstrain. The sequences were aligned using MAFFT, what do you call it?

293
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:24,080
MAFFT? MAFFT. And the alignment was trained to a reference genome in GenBank. And we constructed

294
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:32,400
the phylogenetic tree using the maximum likelihood approach implemented in the IQ tree software.

295
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:42,320
And for the final geographic analysis, we use the tree time to estimate, you know,

296
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:50,240
the location and host time of those internal nerves. And initial analysis shown on the left

297
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:54,240
panel suggested that

298
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:05,120
the sequences from bats, I think by these pink leaf nodes, and hedgehog,

299
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:14,640
not by the yellow leaf nodes, they separated kind of distant from the main clades of sequences

300
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:24,080
formed by humans and camels, as well as a single strain from a llama, I think, the animal.

301
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,440
It is hiding here.

302
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:43,200
And we, so then we just exclude all the sequences of bats and hedgehogs and only focus on the

303
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:47,840
human and the camel genes.

304
00:42:54,160 --> 00:43:01,760
So on the right hand panel, you can see we had several clusters for human and camel genes.

305
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:10,400
We have five clusters. The largest cluster is called C5, which contains majority of the sequences.

306
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:20,480
And you can see the mixture of human and camel sequences throughout the tree, except for the

307
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:26,880
most recent ones, where I think this was more like a sampling using, rather than a

308
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:37,840
systematic pattern. So this mixture of human-camel sequences

309
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:45,920
suggests that there were probably constant importation of sphere number from camel to human.

310
00:43:54,000 --> 00:44:00,000
Now, this figure shows the phylogeny in a much better way because we can we can

311
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:09,040
time here, right? So although the human and camel sequences are mixed together,

312
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:13,680
but if you look at the samples collected after 2016,

313
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:21,520
the human genes are quite distant from the camel genes, right?

314
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:31,520
And the common ancestor was dated around 2007, and the posterior probability for the host being

315
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:37,520
camel, human, kind of 50-50. We later did a sensitivity analysis. We downsampled the human

316
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:45,040
sequences because there's just too many of them. And then the camel will have a 99%

317
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:53,120
for the posterior probability being the common ancestor.

318
00:44:55,920 --> 00:45:00,240
We also tried to associate case fatality rate with sequences.

319
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:05,520
So what we did is we look at, we kind of divide the spatial temporal

320
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:13,760
range into several chunks and calculate the case fatality rate within each chunk.

321
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:20,720
And then we look at the individual sequences and associate them with the case fatality rate

322
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:31,600
in that chunk, the location and the time. And then we, for each sequence, we have a bar

323
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:37,440
with a color indicating the underlying case fatality rate in that space time chunk.

324
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:45,120
And then we average for each cluster to compare the potential difference in case fatality rate

325
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:57,040
between clusters. If you compare C5 to other clusters, C1 to C4, you cannot really see much

326
00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:03,280
difference between the two. Actually, there's only 1% difference in case fatality rate there,

327
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:09,920
only 1%. But it is significant, probably because of the sample size, but we cannot

328
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:20,960
fully interpret that. If you compare only the sub-clade C5.1 with C1 to C4, we actually see

329
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:30,640
a 4% difference, which is not true. So that means the more recent clade is probably more lethal.

330
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:42,560
We also associated the incidence rate with sequences, but we cannot see much signal there,

331
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:56,560
so I'm going to ignore that. Oh, there's another thing I want to share. Okay, so we,

332
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:02,560
remember, we performed some phylogeographic analysis. So let's take a look at a movie.

333
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:06,160
Hopefully, this movie will show. Let's see.

334
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,160
Just a copy-paste.

335
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:37,520
Oh, we're not. We should go back to the window mode, and just copy-paste this one.

336
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:51,520
Let's see if we can do it.

337
00:47:51,520 --> 00:48:16,880
Let's see if it works or not.

338
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:32,240
Oh, I have to move it to...

339
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:42,240
Oh, I have to stop sharing.

340
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:45,600
Oh, I see, I see. Yeah, okay.

341
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:59,600
Let me click on it here.

342
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:14,400
I want to see that geographic location.

343
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:19,920
I'm scrolling down, maybe.

344
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:21,040
Scrolling down.

345
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:29,280
All right, yes, and then replay.

346
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:36,320
I'm sorry for this problem, but it's kind of out of my control.

347
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:40,000
Where is play?

348
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,040
Just click play.

349
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:46,400
Okay, yeah, now let's take a look.

350
00:49:46,400 --> 00:50:11,360
Yeah, it's almost finished. All right, good.

351
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:12,960
Good, okay.

352
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:20,160
Now, let me... Oh, still, that's correct to share a screen, right?

353
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:29,840
Right, okay.

354
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:33,280
Now, some highlights for that movie, right?

355
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:54,640
The top three most likely locations for the common access route were three cities, Riyadh of KSA and now Delta region, which is in Egypt and Jordan.

356
00:50:55,360 --> 00:51:02,480
The possibilities are 31%, 17% and 12% respectively.

357
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:11,760
And Riyadh appears to be the major source of exporting infections, both locally and internationally.

358
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:22,720
And it is the common ancestor node of subclades C3, C4 and C5 for 99% of time.

359
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:35,120
Okay, and the early exportation to Egypt and Jordan occurred well before 2010.

360
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:44,080
And the circulation of the MERS-CoV among camels in East Africa possibly started also before 2010.

361
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:56,960
The virus migrated from Egypt to Ethiopia during 2011-2013, and subsequently to Kenya during 2014-2017.

362
00:51:57,840 --> 00:52:08,560
And that's partially supported by a zoological study conducted in Egypt in 2013, where they also sampled animals from Kenya and found nothing.

363
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:26,800
The intense migration from Riyadh towards local cities in KSA, as well as Abu Dhabi in UAE, started around the 1970s, which matches our knowledge.

364
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:36,080
And Abu Dhabi joined Riyadh as the second home for exporting the virus, both locally and internationally. So that's quite early.

365
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:45,120
And the model also captures the opportunistic exportation to the US as well as to the US.

366
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:57,280
So we also did some kind of detection of

367
00:52:57,840 --> 00:53:10,640
positive selection across proteins and the sites. Remember in the previous slide, see here.

368
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:19,600
Now I'm notating here branch A and branch B. Branch A is kind of separating

369
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:27,040
the hedgehog sequences from the rest, and branch B is separating hedgehog and

370
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:33,840
bat sequences from human and camel sequences. So we performed the

371
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:39,200
positive selection analysis along these two branches.

372
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:58,480
Okay, the first three rows of branch A, we identified three proteins, the non-structural three, nucleoprotein, and this 1AB polyprotein is, I believe, it's from the open reading form 1.

373
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:03,920
I may be wrong, but that's my impression. And we identified the signs

374
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:14,320
with positive selection. Only in this 1AB polyprotein, not in the other two. Along the branch B, we identified these two proteins, including the spike protein.

375
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:21,840
For the branch A, we did not detect the spike protein for any positive selection.

376
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:28,800
And also for the spike protein, we identified these sides to be under high

377
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:40,480
pressure for positive selection. And the three ones marked by red, those are newly found. They did not appear in the literature.

378
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:53,120
And we all know spike protein is the one that most interacts with animal cells.

379
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:55,280
How much time do I have?

380
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:58,240
It's already...

381
00:54:58,240 --> 00:54:59,680
Yeah, already 10 seconds.

382
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:08,880
Okay, okay. Then I'll probably ignore the ecology part. For the ecology part, I can just mention some main findings.

383
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:17,520
What we did here is we used several machine learning approaches like post-signal regression tree,

384
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:26,720
supported by commission, and random forest to learn the ecology of the spike protein.

385
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:42,880
And then we build a meta-learner on top of this. It will give us another round of prediction, and it turns out that the ensemble machine, which is a meta-learner,

386
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:59,440
outperforms the three base models. Not by much, but a little bit. If you look at the AUC, if you look at the accuracy, as well as F1 score and compound,

387
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:23,600
not really a good performance in terms of sensitivity, but sensitivity here is a little bit deceptive because we have very few positive cases.

388
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:34,160
This model is based on about 100 positive districts with confirmed cases, and about 400

389
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:39,200
districts without any detection.

390
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:52,560
And we did identify... Let me see. We did identify the most prominent risk driver for ecology of MERS-CoV. It's actually something called the coverage of bare land.

391
00:56:52,560 --> 00:57:01,520
Bare land, that's very, very difficult to define. Basically, a land without many, you know, vegetation, trees, like that, right?

392
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:07,760
But we also adjusted for camel density here. Camel density is picked up by the model,

393
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:15,600
but not as a very prominent driver. So we want to control the camel density. Then it's bare land,

394
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:22,160
in addition to camel, it may also contain other animal hosts that we have not discovered yet.

395
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:37,360
Okay, so let me just draw some conclusions on the epithelium model.

396
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:41,120
So we observed that the cases with animal contact

397
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:50,560
tend to be older, more likely to be male, symptomatic, and also having underlying conditions. Even though by our

398
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:57,040
logistic model with interactions, we kind of see that once you adjust your model,

399
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:07,280
underlying conditions, adjusting for age and gender, animal contact actually does not always increase the risk of death.

400
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:15,440
Remember, in the older population, and male, it actually decreases the risk of death.

401
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:19,600
But overall, for those older males who are farm workers, animal workers, because they had underlying conditions, and they were old,

402
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:28,880
overall, they do have a higher risk of death.

403
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:32,720
So we should consider promoting some preventive measures, like an educational campaign or personal protection equipment for those workers.

404
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:42,160
But overall, for those older males who are farm workers, animal workers, because they had underlying conditions, and they were old,

405
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:47,840
overall, they do have a higher risk of death. And we need to pay attention to that.

406
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:56,320
So we should consider promoting some preventive measures, like an educational campaign or personal protection equipment for those workers.

407
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:05,760
And animal-to-human transmission events mainly occurred between January and March,

408
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:11,680
and human-to-human transmission occurred later in summer.

409
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:18,240
So that suggests the importance of blocking the spillover from animal to human in the early spring.

410
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:29,920
And also mentioning, we found sample sequences after 2014, many human sequences, and then camel becomes the host for the root ancestor with a very high possibility.

411
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:37,920
And we also found Abu Dhabi of UAE is a hub for international exportation of this virus.

412
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:44,000
So this virus, probably, we should recommend some kind of screening procedure for infected travelers.

413
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:50,480
And the novel amino acids positions that we found on spike protein associated with public selection,

414
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:56,640
those can be potential pockets for the spread of this virus.

415
00:59:56,640 --> 01:00:02,640
So we should consider promoting some preventive measures, like an educational campaign or personal protection equipment for those workers.

416
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:04,800
And the novel amino acids positions that we found on spike protein associated with public selection,

417
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:11,520
those can be potential pockets for development of future antiviral vaccines against this virus.

418
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:17,600
So that's all for that material.

419
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:26,240
And the NP paper is published in this journal, and the ecology paper is published in this journal.

420
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:28,800
Thank you very much. Any questions, you're welcome.

421
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:49,120
Yes, please. I'm really interested about the phylogeny. Can you go back to the figure four or five?

422
01:00:49,520 --> 01:01:07,680
Yeah, that's the one. So, since after 2016, it's really interesting, like, human birds and

423
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:13,760
camels are pretty much distinct. Do you think it's because the sampling bios of the camel,

424
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:21,280
or do you believe there's somehow a low level circulation of human population?

425
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:29,120
That's a good question. I don't have the answer. My intuition is sampling virus is at least a contributing factor.

426
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:36,800
It's hard to imagine, because this virus is endemic in camels. It's hard to imagine it's gone. I don't think it's gone.

427
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:45,920
So, Ryan in the chat would like to know what type of models make up your own sample.

428
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:52,960
Oh, so the base models are a random forest, boosted regression tree, and

429
01:01:53,760 --> 01:02:00,160
support vector machine. And then on top of that, the meta-learner is actually XGBoost.

430
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:08,160
Does that answer your question?

431
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:09,200
Yes, thank you.

432
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:20,400
Yes, so it seems like this is a fairly small tree. Why did you end up choosing

433
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:27,760
using the Nextstrain pipeline as opposed to a different tree building pipeline?

434
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:36,880
It was not my decision. My intuition would always try maybe like a beast first.

435
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:45,360
However, I wouldn't say it's a small data set either, because we have, I think, about 500 sequences together.

436
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:52,640
A beast may need some time to run. And another nice thing about the Nextstrain is that it provides

437
01:02:53,040 --> 01:03:00,320
all sorts of tools together for you to use, and with this nice movie. So I think that's

438
01:03:00,320 --> 01:03:06,080
probably the only reason why we chose Nextstrain. But I think definitely you can try a beast as well,

439
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:11,280
especially for the geographic analysis.

440
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:20,240
Could you tell us more about surveillance or genome sequencing of camel or

441
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:25,520
reservoir species? I think that's really important because it can give us a

442
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:32,640
good background about circulation in these reservoirs and spillover between them.

443
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:39,600
I'm not quite sure whether there is a systematic surveillance system for animals.

444
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:49,520
Actually, in terms of animal hosts, although at least the bats and hedgehogs here

445
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:57,840
if you look into the literature, it's still kind of debatable, right? We all have common sense.

446
01:03:57,840 --> 01:04:03,760
Bats is the natural reservoir for all types of coronaviruses, including MERS,

447
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:10,320
MERS-CoV. But as a matter of fact, so far people have only found, to my knowledge,

448
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:16,080
kind of similar gene segments in the virus as in the form of bats.

449
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:22,320
That's not considered some very solid evidence by many of our biologists and immunologists.

450
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:30,320
Yeah, I know less about the hedgehogs, so I cannot say much about that.

451
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:37,760
So the primary animal host that's solidly convincing people is camels,

452
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:42,960
scum, gondolins. And we should do surveillance.

453
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:50,160
I have a question about student training because you're applying for adjunct

454
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:57,680
faculty position here. So what kind, what type of students would you expect working in your lab,

455
01:04:57,680 --> 01:05:04,480
or how would you train bioinformatics students? In terms of bioinformatics itself,

456
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:14,480
I need a partner like Dr. Liu. Myself, no, I cannot train you. I'm very interested in this

457
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:22,400
field, but myself, I need to be trained as well. But my vision is that, you know,

458
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:29,600
we don't have this vision. We want to combine biological data, gene sequence data. So far,

459
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:33,440
we're only talking about the pathogen sequence, right? It could be human sequence as well,

460
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:39,760
but that's a long shot. And also like human movement data, all together to inform us about

461
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:45,680
the transmission dynamics. And that's also very important to understand how the virus is going to

462
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:51,440
evolve in terms of its transmissibility, pathogenicity, and so on.

463
01:05:54,000 --> 01:06:01,920
So far, there have been some efforts in this kind of joint modeling in the past 10 years, but

464
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:11,440
it's still under investigated. It's still a very promising direction. So anybody with interest in

465
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:20,160
both bioinformatics and statistics and computational methods are welcome to join this effort.

466
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:30,400
Yeah, sure. It says elevation was insignificant in the univariable analysis. Why was it included

467
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:34,800
in the multivariable and into that mix? Good question. Let me check.

468
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:45,920
Elevation. That's for the survival analysis, is that? Yes.

469
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:51,040
Yeah.

470
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:06,560
Oh, this is kind of more like a statistical philosophy question,

471
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:14,640
right? Because here, we did not explore the potential interactions explicitly.

472
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:22,160
So there could be interactions among these factors. And in the univariable analysis,

473
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:27,440
it's not significant. Actually, the p-value is very close to one, but that does not mean

474
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:34,480
it's not having an interaction. Or it could be a confounder. Because if you look at the

475
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:41,760
coverage of a bare land with elevation, there is some correlation there.

476
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:46,880
Right? Not very high, not super high, but there is some substantial correlation there.

477
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:52,240
So we cannot just rule it out. In the multivariable model, we did not just leave

478
01:07:52,240 --> 01:08:00,320
out those non-significant in the multivariate model. We actually add them back one by one

479
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:04,960
to check whether they're going to become significant after adjusting for other factors.

480
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:06,480
So that's the reason.

481
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:16,240
Thank you. All right. If there's no questions, let's send Professor Gao.

482
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:32,800
Yeah, I think I set it up. I know I have to clean up, so I won't be there.

483
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:38,080
All right. I think that's something else.

484
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:41,680
Yeah. Should I go?

485
01:08:41,680 --> 01:08:47,200
You can just show up. I'll show up at the booth, I guess.
