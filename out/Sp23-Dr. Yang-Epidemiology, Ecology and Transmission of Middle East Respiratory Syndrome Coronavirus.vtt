00:00.000 --> 00:29.120
My pleasure to introduce Professor Yang, who joined UGA last semester and as a class chair

00:29.360 --> 00:34.960
of ecology, mathematics, and statistics, but he doesn't have any commitment to

00:35.920 --> 00:45.120
or ecology. So this seminar also serves for his application for the adjunct position with IOB.

00:45.120 --> 00:53.760
So if you're a student and looking for lab, you may want to talk to him. His major research area

00:53.760 --> 01:00.960
is infectious disease, and he is a statistician modeling for infectious disease. As you know,

01:00.960 --> 01:08.000
to understand infectious disease, we need the knowledge in ecology, population genetics,

01:08.000 --> 01:15.600
molecular genetics, to understand evolution of pathogens, and mathematics, you know,

01:15.600 --> 01:21.520
as well as statistics. So it's very hard to find an expert in all of those areas,

01:21.520 --> 01:27.840
and here we go. Professor Yang, so if you're interested in doing research in infectious

01:27.840 --> 01:38.160
disease, you probably want to talk to him. He has a lot of grants. He's already published over 100

01:38.160 --> 01:46.400
papers, and this is, believe me, this is just the first page of his CV. So I cannot read out

01:46.480 --> 01:57.200
all the CVs. It's 19 pages. So he, let's see. Sorry, I'm aging, so I cannot see that. So he

01:57.200 --> 02:10.240
got his PhD in 2004 from Emory, and he did his postdoc at Howard, right, so for the following

02:10.240 --> 02:20.560
year, and then he worked at Brad Hutchinson Cancer Center, and then he moved to University

02:20.560 --> 02:27.600
of Florida, and last semester, he joined again. So today, he's going to talk about epidemiology

02:27.680 --> 02:35.520
and ecology of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus.

02:42.160 --> 02:46.480
Okay, good. Thank you, Liang, for this nice introduction and over compliment.

02:47.040 --> 02:56.160
I'm not expert in everything, and I mainly specialize in modeling of infectious disease

02:56.160 --> 03:03.280
transmission, and just started working with Dr. Liu on how to combine the epidemiological part

03:03.280 --> 03:10.000
and the physiological part into the same model so that we can better model the dynamics of

03:10.000 --> 03:17.200
transmission. Today, I'm going to talk about epidemiology and the ecology of MERS-CoV.

03:19.440 --> 03:24.560
If you read the flyer before, I changed my title a little bit. I used to have

03:24.560 --> 03:31.360
transmission as well, but I found myself too many. I had to cut some, so I moved that one out.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.960
So today, we'll only be talking about epidemiology and the ecology.

03:36.080 --> 03:43.280
Hopefully, you will be interested in these topics. So this is during the work with Dr.

03:43.280 --> 03:50.720
Yichun Fang and Wenqiang Shi at Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, as well as Dr.

03:50.800 --> 03:56.240
Anna Zhang at Shandong University. Anna was a business student in my lab at UF.

03:57.360 --> 04:02.400
That's when she was leading this project, part of this project.

04:03.920 --> 04:06.720
Please feel free to stop me anytime if you have any questions.

04:07.360 --> 04:11.360
So some background about the disease and the pathogen as well.

04:13.040 --> 04:17.120
You're probably quite familiar with this disease because of the pandemic of SARS-CoV-2.

04:19.120 --> 04:26.400
MERS is a respiratory infection disease first found in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

04:27.200 --> 04:36.640
As of January this year, there were a total of 27 countries that have reported about 2,600

04:36.640 --> 04:44.880
lab-confirmed cases, together with 935 deaths. So that's a pretty good number.

04:45.840 --> 04:56.240
That has reported about 2,600 lab-confirmed cases, together with 935 deaths. So that's a

04:56.240 --> 05:00.960
pretty high case fatality rate. We use the CMR of about 36%.

05:03.440 --> 05:09.440
Luckily, human-to-human transmission is pretty rare, and many occurred in healthcare settings

05:09.440 --> 05:17.360
and households. And in healthcare settings, it's pretty much patients who are immune-compromised.

05:17.360 --> 05:20.720
So that's why they are at high risk of transmission.

05:22.160 --> 05:27.280
And the zoonotic infection is mainly driven by exposure to the dummy debris,

05:27.920 --> 05:35.600
wire droplets, fomites, and consumption of some raw products of this animal, such as milk.

05:36.320 --> 05:41.280
And people also suspect the use of chemical urine as a traditional medicine is another

05:41.280 --> 05:51.280
transmission route. And given that there has been no effective treatment or vaccine yet,

05:51.280 --> 05:56.880
so people are very concerned about the potential of this virus causing another global pandemic

05:56.880 --> 06:04.720
if it's fully adapted itself to the human population. And in 2018, WHO incorporated MERS

06:04.720 --> 06:12.480
into its research and development blueprint, which lists a variety of disease pathogens

06:12.480 --> 06:18.080
that people will spend more time developing vaccines toward those pathogens.

06:25.280 --> 06:33.120
And about the virus itself, it's an RNA virus with a genome about 30 kb long.

06:35.520 --> 06:46.480
And MERS-CoV belongs to the lineage C of the genus beta coronavirus. The famous or infamous

06:46.480 --> 06:53.440
SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, they belong to the lineage B. And the common code coronaviruses,

06:53.440 --> 07:00.800
OC43 and HKU1, they belong to the lineage K. So they're related, but a little bit distant

07:00.800 --> 07:10.400
from each other. MERS-CoV was phylogenetically classified into clade A and clade B. A includes

07:10.960 --> 07:17.920
the early detected human cases, viruses, and B includes the more contemporary viruses.

07:17.920 --> 07:25.440
But however, this classification was based on a pretty few number of sequences. So we've done

07:25.440 --> 07:29.280
a much more comprehensive work on this, and we'll show that later.

07:32.960 --> 07:39.600
Although the disease was quite new, but circulation of MERS-like coronaviruses

07:43.280 --> 07:50.080
in Africa and the Arabian Peninsula occurred well before 2012.

07:51.040 --> 07:58.640
And a little bit about the immunity background of this virus. The virus used the S1 protein

07:58.640 --> 08:07.360
to bind to two types of host cell surface molecules. One is called the DPP4, and the other

08:07.360 --> 08:15.280
is the well-known alpha-2 or alpha-3 astatic acids. And it replicates mainly in the nasal

08:15.840 --> 08:25.680
epithelium of dromedaries, but only in the lower respiratory tract of humans. So that's probably

08:25.680 --> 08:33.360
why it's so highly transmissible among the dromedaries, but not so much among human beings.

08:36.320 --> 08:40.480
All right, so that's enough for the background. Let me get into the needs.

08:40.800 --> 08:48.480
We'll try to identify determinants for case fatality rate and also characterize the spatial

08:48.480 --> 08:54.480
division pattern of the disease. And we want to also look at evolution and migration history

08:54.480 --> 09:01.840
of the virus. Finally, we'll provide some more comprehensive picture about the ecology of the

09:01.840 --> 09:08.000
virus. And we'll also look at the evolution and migration history of the virus, and we'll also

09:08.000 --> 09:13.920
picture about the ecology of the virus and associated socio-environmental drivers.

09:14.960 --> 09:19.440
But this talk has two parts. The first two are part one, and this is part two.

09:30.720 --> 09:34.160
So in this slide, I talk about the data sources.

09:34.960 --> 09:41.760
We first collected data on all confirmed human cases, and there are three major sources for that.

09:43.040 --> 09:52.080
We looked at the official reports of WHO. Now, WHO does not provide the line list it used to.

09:52.080 --> 09:59.120
So we were lucky. At that time, we got a line list. And the Food and Agriculture Organization

09:59.680 --> 10:06.000
of the United Nations, as well as the health departments of affected countries.

10:07.600 --> 10:13.680
So we collected demographic data whenever it's available, and the dates of

10:15.600 --> 10:22.000
critical events, like the onset, hospitalization, and the lab confirmation.

10:23.360 --> 10:28.160
The most important one is to explore your history, but it's very simple. It's just whether

10:28.160 --> 10:38.880
the case has had a history of exposure to animal production or other confirmed patient.

10:39.600 --> 10:48.960
And we validate this data via literature research. We also collected a bunch of socio-environmental

10:48.960 --> 10:56.480
variables, which are listed here, and we'll utilize them, especially using, for example,

10:56.480 --> 11:04.720
meteorological data and land cover data for ecology study. The gene sequence data were

11:04.720 --> 11:12.720
downloaded from our gene bank, and we used data up to the June of 2020, and that's also

11:13.280 --> 11:18.880
the time upper limit for the case data we downloaded.

11:27.360 --> 11:33.360
This is an epidemic curve actually provided in the WHO report, and it only listed cases

11:34.240 --> 11:43.200
in the eastern Mediterranean region. It's not for the whole world, but because we want to

11:43.200 --> 11:51.520
check the seasonality, so we decided to focus on the endemic in the zoonotic region instead of the

11:51.520 --> 12:00.640
local region. And it covers from June 2012 to January 2023. This is more comprehensive than

12:00.640 --> 12:08.000
the data that we used. We used up to June of 2020, but luckily there weren't many cases after that.

12:09.920 --> 12:15.040
I mentioned it was first discovered in September 2012, but you can see here,

12:15.040 --> 12:18.960
actually the earliest case shown here can be traced back to early

12:18.960 --> 12:23.440
2012, so there could be some cases retrospectively identified.

12:25.360 --> 12:31.360
All right. Majority of these cases from Saudi Arabia. That's understandable. Everyone knows that.

12:32.640 --> 12:41.520
And we see a huge peak in 2014 and some subsequent large outbreaks in 2015.

12:41.520 --> 12:47.680
And you can also see there were about two peaks per year and sometimes three peaks

12:49.440 --> 12:58.480
right. One in the early spring and the other one probably in the late summer or early fall.

12:59.600 --> 13:08.000
And the early ones in the spring, it's more like an animal exposure in a triggered spinoma.

13:08.000 --> 13:22.320
So here is a summary table of the kind of baseline characteristics of all the

13:22.960 --> 13:27.040
worst cases we included in our study covering this period.

13:27.760 --> 13:34.240
Right. And I colored some of these interesting results.

13:37.200 --> 13:43.120
In Saudi Arabia, it has far more number of cases as well as number of deaths

13:43.120 --> 13:49.920
compared to other countries. And if you look at the CFR, it's also much higher than other regions.

13:50.720 --> 13:54.240
In South Korea, I should say South Korea, sorry for that,

13:55.840 --> 14:05.280
the number of female patients were much higher than other countries.

14:07.040 --> 14:11.840
That's possibly due to, because in Korea, if you know the history of MERS,

14:11.840 --> 14:17.040
there was a big outbreak in, if I remember correctly, it was in 2015.

14:18.000 --> 14:26.400
It's kind of driven by one single imported case. And that patient kind of stimulated large outbreaks

14:26.400 --> 14:32.480
in several hospitals. So it's purely kind of a person-to-person transmission. And in that case,

14:33.040 --> 14:38.960
it doesn't really distinguish between different sexes, right? But for animal exposure, we'll see

14:39.440 --> 14:47.920
later, most of the patients with animal exposure are men. And so that will make some difference.

14:48.720 --> 14:58.720
And in these countries, KSA, UAE, and some other countries, the majority of patients are male.

14:59.600 --> 15:05.600
And South Korea also has a very large percent of hospital-related

15:06.720 --> 15:12.080
patients. And that's exactly because we only had hospital outbreaks in that country.

15:14.480 --> 15:22.320
And the time from disease onset to diagnosis was shortest in South Korea. And that's also

15:22.320 --> 15:27.280
understandable because those were hospital-triggered investigations. They are very efficient, right?

15:28.240 --> 15:41.600
In the United Arab Emirates, we noticed that the age was, the patients were much younger

15:41.600 --> 15:47.920
compared to other countries. And that is probably because of the high proportion of healthcare

15:47.920 --> 15:55.040
workers compared to other countries. And this country also has the highest proportion of

15:55.040 --> 16:06.320
asymptomatic infection. How you identify asymptomatic infection is a very tricky question.

16:06.960 --> 16:16.800
Usually, for syndrome-based surveillance, you only can find symptomatic cases. Because of

16:16.800 --> 16:22.640
this high proportion of healthcare workers, probably they did some regular monitoring

16:22.720 --> 16:27.280
for infection status. And that's how they identified asymptomatic infections.

16:29.840 --> 16:36.640
And this country also has a very long time from disease onset to death. The reason for that

16:36.640 --> 16:46.080
is unknown, but probably related to the management of patient or facility in the hospitals.

16:48.720 --> 16:51.280
So that's for the summary table. Any questions?

16:53.440 --> 17:01.200
Okay. So that's the basic epidemiology. Let's go to more interesting materials.

17:02.960 --> 17:11.360
In this table, we compare the characteristics between cases with animal contact and those without.

17:12.240 --> 17:18.880
About one-fourth of patients were reported animal contact.

17:20.800 --> 17:27.200
So we can see patients with animal contact were much less likely to be female

17:28.720 --> 17:39.920
compared to this proportion. And they were older. And the case fatality rate was much higher.

17:41.840 --> 17:48.400
But we need to be very careful for interpreting this much higher case fatality rate. Because

17:48.400 --> 17:53.680
this animal contact, we'll see later, it's confounded with other factors like age,

17:53.680 --> 18:00.960
like baseline chronic conditions. If we really want to assess animal contact

18:01.600 --> 18:05.840
effect on case fatality rate, we need to adjust for those confounders.

18:06.800 --> 18:15.120
It's also less likely to be asymptomatic. But that, again, is a question mark. That probably

18:15.120 --> 18:26.400
does not give you any epidemiological... It doesn't describe epidemiology in that regard

18:26.400 --> 18:32.160
faithfully. Because for people with animal contact, many of them probably asymptomatic,

18:32.480 --> 18:35.520
asymptomatic, and they were not captured by this learning system.

18:38.640 --> 18:43.280
And they had much higher proportion of underlying conditions, as I mentioned before.

18:44.480 --> 18:50.240
So they're probably at higher risk to death. And they generally had a much longer time from

18:50.240 --> 18:57.120
the disease onset to diagnosis. So we'll find later. So that will also probably increase the

18:57.120 --> 19:05.280
fatality rate. But for some reason, a slightly longer time from disease onset to death,

19:05.280 --> 19:12.240
which we don't quite understand, probably related to some immunology issues.

19:13.120 --> 19:18.560
If we look at the proportion of animal contact, a patient with animal contact,

19:18.560 --> 19:22.160
across the years, now these proportions are the low proportions.

19:22.720 --> 19:29.360
Even though we had fewer and fewer cases over the years, we actually see a different story

19:29.360 --> 19:35.440
for this proportion of animal contact. It increases up to 2018, and then they kind of

19:35.440 --> 19:40.400
plateaued. And it's not decreasing yet. I'm not sure about the most recent years.

19:40.400 --> 19:43.760
The data is not available yet.

19:56.240 --> 20:03.680
So this figure shows the spatial distribution of human MERS cases in the whole globe.

20:04.080 --> 20:12.640
We categorize the countries into four categories. The first two categories

20:13.760 --> 20:23.520
corresponds to the colors of, I would say, maybe I can call that pink, and a little bit of purple.

20:24.080 --> 20:32.880
Those countries had zoonotic transmissions, basically animal exposure. The pink ones

20:33.040 --> 20:39.200
reported a human-to-human transmission, and the purple one did not report,

20:39.200 --> 20:44.240
or at least did not find concrete evidence for human-to-human transmission.

20:44.880 --> 20:50.080
And if you look at this map, only Kuwait is the country colored with purple.

20:51.520 --> 20:56.640
And it doesn't really mean it did not have human-to-human transmission. I'll explain why.

20:57.600 --> 21:03.120
The other two categories are the countries with many important infections,

21:03.760 --> 21:11.280
so they're colored with yellow or brown. The yellow indicates there was human-to-human

21:11.280 --> 21:18.640
transmission following the importation. And the brown ones, I believe,

21:20.480 --> 21:26.160
are the ones without subsequent human-to-human. Oh no, sorry, it's reversed. The yellow ones,

21:26.480 --> 21:32.240
did not have human-to-human transmission, but the brown ones had this type of incidence.

21:34.720 --> 21:41.680
All right, and for each country with reported cases, we impose a bar chart like this,

21:42.320 --> 21:48.160
and the size of the bar indicates number of cases, and then the colors indicate

21:49.280 --> 21:55.520
animal contact history. The red indicates the proportion of patients with animal contact.

21:56.160 --> 22:04.400
And if you look at Kuwait, it's basically red and green. Green simply means unknown,

22:05.200 --> 22:10.960
right? So whether there were human-to-human transmission, we don't know, just not confirmed.

22:13.200 --> 22:19.360
And interestingly, Qatar is the country with the highest proportion of animal contact,

22:20.160 --> 22:30.240
followed by ASA, UAE, and Oman. Some small countries like these,

22:31.520 --> 22:38.560
Bahrain has too few cases, so I wouldn't make any conclusion for that.

22:38.560 --> 22:58.000
Some European countries also reported patients with animal contact, as well as here in Southeast

22:58.000 --> 23:08.080
Asia. But these people most likely already had animal contact before they entered

23:08.560 --> 23:20.320
those countries. So to look at what factors contributed to the risk of death,

23:20.320 --> 23:30.480
so we performed a standard logistic regression. For all the variables that we have that we think

23:30.480 --> 23:35.200
are related, we throw them into the model, we perform the univariable analysis and the

23:35.200 --> 23:41.840
multivariable analysis, and all these factors we throw in are significant in both univariable and

23:41.840 --> 23:51.840
multivariable analysis. These are strong predictors for case fatality. Let's just go ahead with the

23:51.840 --> 24:03.280
multivariable analysis. Don't look at the age, sex, and animal contact yet, because we have

24:03.280 --> 24:11.120
interaction terms in the model. And these numbers, like this high number, 10.52, does not represent a

24:11.120 --> 24:16.560
marginal effect of age group. It does not. It's just specific to one particular subgroup, and I'll talk

24:16.560 --> 24:25.520
about that later. So let's just look at the effects of, say, a healthcare worker, as much lower risk

24:25.520 --> 24:35.680
of death. And underlying condition, well, that's a more than three-fold increase in the risk of death.

24:37.520 --> 24:46.160
OTC stands for the time from onset to confirmation, it's basically diagnosis, right? Then

24:46.560 --> 24:55.200
this has also a significant result. A longer time from onset to confirmation

24:55.200 --> 25:02.800
increases the risk of death. And if we compare the years, we divide the time into three segments,

25:02.800 --> 25:08.880
and this early phase, this middle phase with large outbreaks, and this later phase with very few cases.

25:09.440 --> 25:16.640
And all compared to the early years, we can see a jump in the risk of death. That's probably,

25:17.360 --> 25:24.160
at least partly due to the constrained, exhausted healthcare facilities, because the large number

25:24.160 --> 25:30.720
of patients. And in the later years, we see a slightly decrease in the risk of death,

25:31.280 --> 25:39.600
possibly related to improved patient management, and also the much fewer number of patients.

25:41.440 --> 25:50.080
So we left out the most three interesting factors, age, sex, and animal contact. So let's get into those.

25:50.640 --> 25:59.440
In this table, we look at age effect, conditioning on sex and animal contact.

26:02.640 --> 26:11.040
Let's focus on the adjusted odd ratio directly. These are all pretty big numbers,

26:11.600 --> 26:19.120
these are all pretty big numbers, all significant. But let's do some comparison.

26:19.760 --> 26:29.120
Let's first compare the results between female and male, right?

26:29.120 --> 26:33.760
But you have to condition on the same contact history, right? So with contact history, with

26:33.760 --> 26:42.640
animal contact history, if you compare female with male, and then without contact history, female with

26:49.120 --> 26:53.680
female with male, right? Without actually comparing this guy, this guy with that guy.

26:54.560 --> 27:01.440
So basically, this is bigger than that, and this is bigger than that. So within females,

27:02.080 --> 27:07.440
age effect is more prominent, regardless of animal contact history.

27:10.880 --> 27:17.200
Age effect is basically comparing the older age to the younger age.

27:18.480 --> 27:24.160
And this number shows in the previous table, it's just for this particular subset of population.

27:24.880 --> 27:33.600
So age is the most prominent driver for the risk of death. And that's not affected by

27:35.440 --> 27:43.120
by either sex or, no, it is affected by sex, right? In female, it's more prominent.

27:43.680 --> 27:50.080
And it's not that affected, it is also affected by animal contact. Let's compare the animal contact history.

27:50.240 --> 28:02.880
So if you look at, just compare with to without, with to without, and with to without,

28:04.400 --> 28:12.160
you can see without animal contact, age effect is more prominent, regardless of the underlying sex.

28:12.160 --> 28:19.760
So that's quite interesting. Why is that? Why is that?

28:23.120 --> 28:31.200
Remember, males, many of them were actually farm workers, they had animal exposure. So

28:33.280 --> 28:40.800
we can reasonably speculate that these patients were constantly challenged by the virus.

28:42.960 --> 28:48.800
Okay, probably that's a buildup of immunity towards this virus.

28:50.080 --> 28:56.640
So after adjusting for the underlying conditions, and adjusted for the

29:00.560 --> 29:04.000
yeah, adjusted for underlying conditions and some other risk factors,

29:04.960 --> 29:14.320
we can see the difference in the age group between people with, without animal contact.

29:14.320 --> 29:20.320
With animal contact, the age effect is not that prominent, but without, it is very prominent.

29:23.040 --> 29:32.400
And most of the animal workers, they were older than younger. So that's for age effect.

29:32.480 --> 29:36.480
Let's look at the effect of gender.

29:45.440 --> 29:54.160
We don't see many strong signals. The only statistically significant result is within

29:54.160 --> 30:02.240
the subgroup of male, the older patients without animal contact.

30:04.000 --> 30:08.000
And male has a much higher risk of death than female.

30:10.560 --> 30:19.600
However, we also noticed that this effect is, you know, has some kind of a marginal signal here.

30:19.600 --> 30:23.600
And it is in the opposite direction compared to what we see here.

30:23.600 --> 30:30.080
And this subgroup is for the younger, no, for the older patients with animal contact.

30:34.320 --> 30:39.360
So that's, that's also quite interesting. For younger patients without animal contact,

30:40.000 --> 30:46.160
male has much higher risk of death. But within older patients with animal contact,

30:46.560 --> 30:52.960
male has actually lower risk of death.

30:55.520 --> 30:59.680
And that again, give us a difficult question to answer, why is that?

31:00.880 --> 31:08.800
However, we should also notice that within the category of older patients with animal contact

31:08.800 --> 31:15.200
and female, we have small number. So that's why this is not statistically significant.

31:16.160 --> 31:24.480
So that could be just due to random noise. So maybe we should not over-interpret this 0.45.

31:27.680 --> 31:34.080
You actually use a mouse because I don't think, and this is my laser point, that means online.

31:35.840 --> 31:38.320
You cannot see that? You actually use mouse.

31:38.320 --> 31:45.760
Yeah, let me use mouse. I apologize to the online audience.

31:48.240 --> 31:55.680
All right, now finally, let's look at the effect of animal contact conditioning on sex and age group.

31:56.640 --> 32:11.120
Now, here, let's just focus on the significant results. The most significant result is this guy.

32:11.120 --> 32:16.640
That's ignored, unknown category, just to focus on what we've done.

32:16.960 --> 32:23.440
Right, so within the subgroup of female patients and younger female patients,

32:24.080 --> 32:33.520
we see a huge increased risk of death for patients with animal contact.

32:35.200 --> 32:42.240
Remember, these are female patients. Most animal workers were males.

32:42.240 --> 32:52.080
So females, if they had animal contact, it's probably more likely to be a vocational contact,

32:52.080 --> 32:59.680
not a professional contact. So that means you may not have to build up immunity against this virus.

33:00.880 --> 33:07.600
Right, so once you had contact with animal and got infected, then it's probably a high risk of

33:07.600 --> 33:14.960
death. And this virus just jumped from animal to human, has not been adapted much to the human

33:15.520 --> 33:23.200
immune system. But if you look at the subgroup of male patients, the older male patients,

33:24.160 --> 33:29.920
if you look at with, without animal contact, you see a huge reduction in the risk of death.

33:30.160 --> 33:34.720
And most of these male patients with animal contact, especially the older ones,

33:35.440 --> 33:43.280
they were actually animal workers. They had probably long exposure to the virus.

33:50.080 --> 33:57.280
Any questions? A lot of information here, difficult to digest in such a short time.

33:59.920 --> 34:20.000
Oh, I already see people have put in chat. Okay, let's move on. So those were for the

34:20.560 --> 34:26.560
risk factors for death. Now let's look at the spatial diffusion pattern.

34:30.080 --> 34:42.160
So what we did here is we look at the time from the first case overall to the first case

34:42.160 --> 34:49.920
in each local district. That's the first time the local district was invaded by this virus.

34:50.560 --> 35:00.320
With this time as my outcome, I did some, you know, spatial smoothing to construct this contour

35:00.320 --> 35:13.760
plot. And this contour plot can tell me the diffusion pattern. And the wider gap between the

35:14.720 --> 35:30.880
two contours indicates, let me put it this way, because the gap between each contour plot is

35:31.680 --> 35:40.320
kind of fixed for the time interval, 200 days. And a wider gap means a longer spatial distance.

35:41.120 --> 35:54.320
So that means a faster spread, right? The first case, first case was here in a city

35:54.320 --> 36:04.800
called Bisho, somewhere in south, in western KSA. And this star marks the first patient that

36:04.800 --> 36:14.480
sparked a outbreak, human patient cluster. So this Bisho is kind of in the central

36:16.240 --> 36:26.000
point of these contour plots. And in the more recent times, we can see actually faster spreading

36:26.000 --> 36:33.600
and the direction was towards Oman and somewhere of UAE.

36:36.560 --> 36:44.560
Right. But that's a characteristic of this plot. We did not show the uncertainty, right?

36:44.560 --> 36:52.160
So probably here you have fewer data, then uncertainty could be high. And whether the

36:52.160 --> 36:59.200
conclusion that they have fastest spreading, maybe just a noise. But however, if you look

36:59.200 --> 37:07.200
at this figure, this map here, let me use mouse again. If you look at the map in the right panel,

37:07.920 --> 37:14.880
you can see in this corner, we still have a bunch of cases. So those cases will inform

37:14.880 --> 37:21.120
the construction of this contour plot. So the signal here in this corner should be reliable.

37:23.120 --> 37:30.880
Right. And you can also notice that we overlay this map with the transportation network.

37:31.440 --> 37:40.320
The white, black lines indicate railway and these gray lines indicate the major roads.

37:42.000 --> 37:48.080
And you can see a pretty good overlap of the cases with this transportation network.

37:48.080 --> 37:52.400
And that's what we're going to show in another model fitting.

37:59.520 --> 38:06.560
So here we perform the survival analysis. Again, the outcome is a time from the first

38:06.560 --> 38:16.640
ever reported worst case to the first importation of case into each district.

38:17.200 --> 38:25.680
The so-called district here, it is a second level administrative unit in most countries,

38:25.680 --> 38:33.200
except for KSA. Because KSA is relatively big. So in case A, we use county, which is a third level

38:33.200 --> 38:42.240
administrative area. And we fit this survival model, trying to look at, this is not an

38:42.240 --> 38:46.560
ecological model. It's just to try to look at what might have contributed to

38:47.360 --> 38:52.400
the invasion of the virus into these different spatial units. Right. Again,

38:52.400 --> 38:58.160
that's just a look at the multivariable analysis. And here we are estimating hazard ratio.

39:03.040 --> 39:09.440
The most prominent hazard ratio is related to the intersection with the main road.

39:09.760 --> 39:20.320
So after that, it was elevation, the higher elevation, the higher hazard ratio.

39:21.520 --> 39:28.000
And also intersection with railway, it more than doubled the hazard of invasion.

39:30.080 --> 39:37.040
And interestingly, the coverage of cropland, it seems to deter the spread, which is also

39:37.040 --> 39:53.600
understandable. These bio variables, they are meteorological variables. And I listed the

39:53.600 --> 40:01.040
interpretations here. Bio one is simply the annual average temperature. And the bio two is the

40:01.040 --> 40:05.760
average diurnal range of temperature, which is simply is kind of the average.

40:08.160 --> 40:13.040
The difference between the maximum temperature and a minimum temperature within each month,

40:13.040 --> 40:21.440
then you take an average. It reflects the variation over time, but within each month.

40:22.080 --> 40:29.600
So these two had shown some significant results, increasing the higher temperature or the higher

40:30.400 --> 40:34.480
mortality, increase the hazard of invasion.

40:45.280 --> 40:49.360
Finally, comes down to the something that may be interesting.

40:49.840 --> 40:59.120
So we collected the whole genome sequence from GenBank. And we analyzed these sequences using

40:59.120 --> 41:08.960
the toolkits provided by Nextstrain. The sequences were aligned using MAFFT, what do you call it?

41:09.760 --> 41:24.080
MAFFT? MAFFT. And the alignment was trained to a reference genome in GenBank. And we constructed

41:24.080 --> 41:32.400
the phylogenetic tree using the maximum likelihood approach implemented in the IQ tree software.

41:33.200 --> 41:42.320
And for the final geographic analysis, we use the tree time to estimate, you know,

41:42.320 --> 41:50.240
the location and host time of those internal nerves. And initial analysis shown on the left

41:50.880 --> 41:54.240
panel suggested that

41:56.480 --> 42:05.120
the sequences from bats, I think by these pink leaf nodes, and hedgehog,

42:05.680 --> 42:14.640
not by the yellow leaf nodes, they separated kind of distant from the main clades of sequences

42:14.640 --> 42:24.080
formed by humans and camels, as well as a single strain from a llama, I think, the animal.

42:25.200 --> 42:27.440
It is hiding here.

42:32.880 --> 42:43.200
And we, so then we just exclude all the sequences of bats and hedgehogs and only focus on the

42:44.960 --> 42:47.840
human and the camel genes.

42:54.160 --> 43:01.760
So on the right hand panel, you can see we had several clusters for human and camel genes.

43:01.760 --> 43:10.400
We have five clusters. The largest cluster is called C5, which contains majority of the sequences.

43:11.280 --> 43:20.480
And you can see the mixture of human and camel sequences throughout the tree, except for the

43:20.480 --> 43:26.880
most recent ones, where I think this was more like a sampling using, rather than a

43:29.920 --> 43:37.840
systematic pattern. So this mixture of human-camel sequences

43:38.320 --> 43:45.920
suggests that there were probably constant importation of sphere number from camel to human.

43:54.000 --> 44:00.000
Now, this figure shows the phylogeny in a much better way because we can we can

44:00.400 --> 44:09.040
time here, right? So although the human and camel sequences are mixed together,

44:09.040 --> 44:13.680
but if you look at the samples collected after 2016,

44:15.520 --> 44:21.520
the human genes are quite distant from the camel genes, right?

44:22.080 --> 44:31.520
And the common ancestor was dated around 2007, and the posterior probability for the host being

44:31.520 --> 44:37.520
camel, human, kind of 50-50. We later did a sensitivity analysis. We downsampled the human

44:38.320 --> 44:45.040
sequences because there's just too many of them. And then the camel will have a 99%

44:45.040 --> 44:53.120
for the posterior probability being the common ancestor.

44:55.920 --> 45:00.240
We also tried to associate case fatality rate with sequences.

45:00.240 --> 45:05.520
So what we did is we look at, we kind of divide the spatial temporal

45:07.760 --> 45:13.760
range into several chunks and calculate the case fatality rate within each chunk.

45:13.760 --> 45:20.720
And then we look at the individual sequences and associate them with the case fatality rate

45:21.680 --> 45:31.600
in that chunk, the location and the time. And then we, for each sequence, we have a bar

45:31.600 --> 45:37.440
with a color indicating the underlying case fatality rate in that space time chunk.

45:38.160 --> 45:45.120
And then we average for each cluster to compare the potential difference in case fatality rate

45:46.240 --> 45:57.040
between clusters. If you compare C5 to other clusters, C1 to C4, you cannot really see much

45:57.040 --> 46:03.280
difference between the two. Actually, there's only 1% difference in case fatality rate there,

46:03.280 --> 46:09.920
only 1%. But it is significant, probably because of the sample size, but we cannot

46:09.920 --> 46:20.960
fully interpret that. If you compare only the sub-clade C5.1 with C1 to C4, we actually see

46:20.960 --> 46:30.640
a 4% difference, which is not true. So that means the more recent clade is probably more lethal.

46:34.240 --> 46:42.560
We also associated the incidence rate with sequences, but we cannot see much signal there,

46:42.560 --> 46:56.560
so I'm going to ignore that. Oh, there's another thing I want to share. Okay, so we,

46:57.280 --> 47:02.560
remember, we performed some phylogeographic analysis. So let's take a look at a movie.

47:03.360 --> 47:06.160
Hopefully, this movie will show. Let's see.

47:12.800 --> 47:14.160
Just a copy-paste.

47:14.160 --> 47:37.520
Oh, we're not. We should go back to the window mode, and just copy-paste this one.

47:44.160 --> 47:51.520
Let's see if we can do it.

47:51.520 --> 48:16.880
Let's see if it works or not.

48:17.840 --> 48:32.240
Oh, I have to move it to...

48:39.440 --> 48:42.240
Oh, I have to stop sharing.

48:42.320 --> 48:45.600
Oh, I see, I see. Yeah, okay.

48:53.600 --> 48:59.600
Let me click on it here.

48:59.600 --> 49:14.400
I want to see that geographic location.

49:18.240 --> 49:19.920
I'm scrolling down, maybe.

49:20.320 --> 49:21.040
Scrolling down.

49:25.920 --> 49:29.280
All right, yes, and then replay.

49:31.280 --> 49:36.320
I'm sorry for this problem, but it's kind of out of my control.

49:39.040 --> 49:40.000
Where is play?

49:40.000 --> 49:41.040
Just click play.

49:41.440 --> 49:46.400
Okay, yeah, now let's take a look.

49:46.400 --> 50:11.360
Yeah, it's almost finished. All right, good.

50:11.360 --> 50:12.960
Good, okay.

50:16.080 --> 50:20.160
Now, let me... Oh, still, that's correct to share a screen, right?

50:26.720 --> 50:29.840
Right, okay.

50:29.840 --> 50:33.280
Now, some highlights for that movie, right?

50:33.600 --> 50:54.640
The top three most likely locations for the common access route were three cities, Riyadh of KSA and now Delta region, which is in Egypt and Jordan.

50:55.360 --> 51:02.480
The possibilities are 31%, 17% and 12% respectively.

51:03.040 --> 51:11.760
And Riyadh appears to be the major source of exporting infections, both locally and internationally.

51:12.960 --> 51:22.720
And it is the common ancestor node of subclades C3, C4 and C5 for 99% of time.

51:25.600 --> 51:35.120
Okay, and the early exportation to Egypt and Jordan occurred well before 2010.

51:35.680 --> 51:44.080
And the circulation of the MERS-CoV among camels in East Africa possibly started also before 2010.

51:45.040 --> 51:56.960
The virus migrated from Egypt to Ethiopia during 2011-2013, and subsequently to Kenya during 2014-2017.

51:57.840 --> 52:08.560
And that's partially supported by a zoological study conducted in Egypt in 2013, where they also sampled animals from Kenya and found nothing.

52:09.520 --> 52:26.800
The intense migration from Riyadh towards local cities in KSA, as well as Abu Dhabi in UAE, started around the 1970s, which matches our knowledge.

52:26.800 --> 52:36.080
And Abu Dhabi joined Riyadh as the second home for exporting the virus, both locally and internationally. So that's quite early.

52:36.160 --> 52:45.120
And the model also captures the opportunistic exportation to the US as well as to the US.

52:50.960 --> 52:57.280
So we also did some kind of detection of

52:57.840 --> 53:10.640
positive selection across proteins and the sites. Remember in the previous slide, see here.

53:11.280 --> 53:19.600
Now I'm notating here branch A and branch B. Branch A is kind of separating

53:19.840 --> 53:27.040
the hedgehog sequences from the rest, and branch B is separating hedgehog and

53:28.240 --> 53:33.840
bat sequences from human and camel sequences. So we performed the

53:35.760 --> 53:39.200
positive selection analysis along these two branches.

53:39.760 --> 53:58.480
Okay, the first three rows of branch A, we identified three proteins, the non-structural three, nucleoprotein, and this 1AB polyprotein is, I believe, it's from the open reading form 1.

53:58.480 --> 54:03.920
I may be wrong, but that's my impression. And we identified the signs

54:04.080 --> 54:14.320
with positive selection. Only in this 1AB polyprotein, not in the other two. Along the branch B, we identified these two proteins, including the spike protein.

54:15.120 --> 54:21.840
For the branch A, we did not detect the spike protein for any positive selection.

54:22.560 --> 54:28.800
And also for the spike protein, we identified these sides to be under high

54:29.280 --> 54:40.480
pressure for positive selection. And the three ones marked by red, those are newly found. They did not appear in the literature.

54:44.480 --> 54:53.120
And we all know spike protein is the one that most interacts with animal cells.

54:54.080 --> 54:55.280
How much time do I have?

54:57.680 --> 54:58.240
It's already...

54:58.240 --> 54:59.680
Yeah, already 10 seconds.

54:59.680 --> 55:08.880
Okay, okay. Then I'll probably ignore the ecology part. For the ecology part, I can just mention some main findings.

55:09.440 --> 55:17.520
What we did here is we used several machine learning approaches like post-signal regression tree,

55:18.240 --> 55:26.720
supported by commission, and random forest to learn the ecology of the spike protein.

55:27.280 --> 55:42.880
And then we build a meta-learner on top of this. It will give us another round of prediction, and it turns out that the ensemble machine, which is a meta-learner,

55:42.880 --> 55:59.440
outperforms the three base models. Not by much, but a little bit. If you look at the AUC, if you look at the accuracy, as well as F1 score and compound,

55:59.920 --> 56:23.600
not really a good performance in terms of sensitivity, but sensitivity here is a little bit deceptive because we have very few positive cases.

56:24.160 --> 56:34.160
This model is based on about 100 positive districts with confirmed cases, and about 400

56:37.360 --> 56:39.200
districts without any detection.

56:39.280 --> 56:52.560
And we did identify... Let me see. We did identify the most prominent risk driver for ecology of MERS-CoV. It's actually something called the coverage of bare land.

56:52.560 --> 57:01.520
Bare land, that's very, very difficult to define. Basically, a land without many, you know, vegetation, trees, like that, right?

57:03.280 --> 57:07.760
But we also adjusted for camel density here. Camel density is picked up by the model,

57:09.120 --> 57:15.600
but not as a very prominent driver. So we want to control the camel density. Then it's bare land,

57:16.160 --> 57:22.160
in addition to camel, it may also contain other animal hosts that we have not discovered yet.

57:30.160 --> 57:37.360
Okay, so let me just draw some conclusions on the epithelium model.

57:38.080 --> 57:41.120
So we observed that the cases with animal contact

57:42.320 --> 57:50.560
tend to be older, more likely to be male, symptomatic, and also having underlying conditions. Even though by our

57:51.440 --> 57:57.040
logistic model with interactions, we kind of see that once you adjust your model,

57:57.520 --> 58:07.280
underlying conditions, adjusting for age and gender, animal contact actually does not always increase the risk of death.

58:08.160 --> 58:15.440
Remember, in the older population, and male, it actually decreases the risk of death.

58:16.240 --> 58:19.600
But overall, for those older males who are farm workers, animal workers, because they had underlying conditions, and they were old,

58:20.800 --> 58:28.880
overall, they do have a higher risk of death.

58:29.520 --> 58:32.720
So we should consider promoting some preventive measures, like an educational campaign or personal protection equipment for those workers.

58:34.320 --> 58:42.160
But overall, for those older males who are farm workers, animal workers, because they had underlying conditions, and they were old,

58:42.160 --> 58:47.840
overall, they do have a higher risk of death. And we need to pay attention to that.

58:49.360 --> 58:56.320
So we should consider promoting some preventive measures, like an educational campaign or personal protection equipment for those workers.

58:57.280 --> 59:05.760
And animal-to-human transmission events mainly occurred between January and March,

59:06.800 --> 59:11.680
and human-to-human transmission occurred later in summer.

59:11.680 --> 59:18.240
So that suggests the importance of blocking the spillover from animal to human in the early spring.

59:18.880 --> 59:29.920
And also mentioning, we found sample sequences after 2014, many human sequences, and then camel becomes the host for the root ancestor with a very high possibility.

59:29.920 --> 59:37.920
And we also found Abu Dhabi of UAE is a hub for international exportation of this virus.

59:38.000 --> 59:44.000
So this virus, probably, we should recommend some kind of screening procedure for infected travelers.

59:44.000 --> 59:50.480
And the novel amino acids positions that we found on spike protein associated with public selection,

59:50.480 --> 59:56.640
those can be potential pockets for the spread of this virus.

59:56.640 --> 01:00:02.640
So we should consider promoting some preventive measures, like an educational campaign or personal protection equipment for those workers.

01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:04.800
And the novel amino acids positions that we found on spike protein associated with public selection,

01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:11.520
those can be potential pockets for development of future antiviral vaccines against this virus.

01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:17.600
So that's all for that material.

01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:26.240
And the NP paper is published in this journal, and the ecology paper is published in this journal.

01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:28.800
Thank you very much. Any questions, you're welcome.

01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:49.120
Yes, please. I'm really interested about the phylogeny. Can you go back to the figure four or five?

01:00:49.520 --> 01:01:07.680
Yeah, that's the one. So, since after 2016, it's really interesting, like, human birds and

01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:13.760
camels are pretty much distinct. Do you think it's because the sampling bios of the camel,

01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:21.280
or do you believe there's somehow a low level circulation of human population?

01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:29.120
That's a good question. I don't have the answer. My intuition is sampling virus is at least a contributing factor.

01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:36.800
It's hard to imagine, because this virus is endemic in camels. It's hard to imagine it's gone. I don't think it's gone.

01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:45.920
So, Ryan in the chat would like to know what type of models make up your own sample.

01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:52.960
Oh, so the base models are a random forest, boosted regression tree, and

01:01:53.760 --> 01:02:00.160
support vector machine. And then on top of that, the meta-learner is actually XGBoost.

01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:08.160
Does that answer your question?

01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:09.200
Yes, thank you.

01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:20.400
Yes, so it seems like this is a fairly small tree. Why did you end up choosing

01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:27.760
using the Nextstrain pipeline as opposed to a different tree building pipeline?

01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:36.880
It was not my decision. My intuition would always try maybe like a beast first.

01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:45.360
However, I wouldn't say it's a small data set either, because we have, I think, about 500 sequences together.

01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:52.640
A beast may need some time to run. And another nice thing about the Nextstrain is that it provides

01:02:53.040 --> 01:03:00.320
all sorts of tools together for you to use, and with this nice movie. So I think that's

01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:06.080
probably the only reason why we chose Nextstrain. But I think definitely you can try a beast as well,

01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:11.280
especially for the geographic analysis.

01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:20.240
Could you tell us more about surveillance or genome sequencing of camel or

01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:25.520
reservoir species? I think that's really important because it can give us a

01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:32.640
good background about circulation in these reservoirs and spillover between them.

01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:39.600
I'm not quite sure whether there is a systematic surveillance system for animals.

01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:49.520
Actually, in terms of animal hosts, although at least the bats and hedgehogs here

01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:57.840
if you look into the literature, it's still kind of debatable, right? We all have common sense.

01:03:57.840 --> 01:04:03.760
Bats is the natural reservoir for all types of coronaviruses, including MERS,

01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:10.320
MERS-CoV. But as a matter of fact, so far people have only found, to my knowledge,

01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:16.080
kind of similar gene segments in the virus as in the form of bats.

01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:22.320
That's not considered some very solid evidence by many of our biologists and immunologists.

01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:30.320
Yeah, I know less about the hedgehogs, so I cannot say much about that.

01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:37.760
So the primary animal host that's solidly convincing people is camels,

01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:42.960
scum, gondolins. And we should do surveillance.

01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:50.160
I have a question about student training because you're applying for adjunct

01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:57.680
faculty position here. So what kind, what type of students would you expect working in your lab,

01:04:57.680 --> 01:05:04.480
or how would you train bioinformatics students? In terms of bioinformatics itself,

01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:14.480
I need a partner like Dr. Liu. Myself, no, I cannot train you. I'm very interested in this

01:05:15.040 --> 01:05:22.400
field, but myself, I need to be trained as well. But my vision is that, you know,

01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:29.600
we don't have this vision. We want to combine biological data, gene sequence data. So far,

01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:33.440
we're only talking about the pathogen sequence, right? It could be human sequence as well,

01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:39.760
but that's a long shot. And also like human movement data, all together to inform us about

01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:45.680
the transmission dynamics. And that's also very important to understand how the virus is going to

01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:51.440
evolve in terms of its transmissibility, pathogenicity, and so on.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:06:01.920
So far, there have been some efforts in this kind of joint modeling in the past 10 years, but

01:06:03.440 --> 01:06:11.440
it's still under investigated. It's still a very promising direction. So anybody with interest in

01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:20.160
both bioinformatics and statistics and computational methods are welcome to join this effort.

01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:30.400
Yeah, sure. It says elevation was insignificant in the univariable analysis. Why was it included

01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:34.800
in the multivariable and into that mix? Good question. Let me check.

01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:45.920
Elevation. That's for the survival analysis, is that? Yes.

01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:51.040
Yeah.

01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:06.560
Oh, this is kind of more like a statistical philosophy question,

01:07:07.520 --> 01:07:14.640
right? Because here, we did not explore the potential interactions explicitly.

01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:22.160
So there could be interactions among these factors. And in the univariable analysis,

01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:27.440
it's not significant. Actually, the p-value is very close to one, but that does not mean

01:07:28.480 --> 01:07:34.480
it's not having an interaction. Or it could be a confounder. Because if you look at the

01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:41.760
coverage of a bare land with elevation, there is some correlation there.

01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:46.880
Right? Not very high, not super high, but there is some substantial correlation there.

01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:52.240
So we cannot just rule it out. In the multivariable model, we did not just leave

01:07:52.240 --> 01:08:00.320
out those non-significant in the multivariate model. We actually add them back one by one

01:08:00.320 --> 01:08:04.960
to check whether they're going to become significant after adjusting for other factors.

01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:06.480
So that's the reason.

01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:16.240
Thank you. All right. If there's no questions, let's send Professor Gao.

01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:32.800
Yeah, I think I set it up. I know I have to clean up, so I won't be there.

01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:38.080
All right. I think that's something else.

01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:41.680
Yeah. Should I go?

01:08:41.680 --> 01:08:47.200
You can just show up. I'll show up at the booth, I guess.
