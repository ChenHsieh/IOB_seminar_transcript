0	29120	My pleasure to introduce Professor Yang, who joined UGA last semester and as a class chair
29360	34960	of ecology, mathematics, and statistics, but he doesn't have any commitment to
35920	45120	or ecology. So this seminar also serves for his application for the adjunct position with IOB.
45120	53760	So if you're a student and looking for lab, you may want to talk to him. His major research area
53760	60960	is infectious disease, and he is a statistician modeling for infectious disease. As you know,
60960	68000	to understand infectious disease, we need the knowledge in ecology, population genetics,
68000	75600	molecular genetics, to understand evolution of pathogens, and mathematics, you know,
75600	81520	as well as statistics. So it's very hard to find an expert in all of those areas,
81520	87840	and here we go. Professor Yang, so if you're interested in doing research in infectious
87840	98160	disease, you probably want to talk to him. He has a lot of grants. He's already published over 100
98160	106400	papers, and this is, believe me, this is just the first page of his CV. So I cannot read out
106480	117200	all the CVs. It's 19 pages. So he, let's see. Sorry, I'm aging, so I cannot see that. So he
117200	130240	got his PhD in 2004 from Emory, and he did his postdoc at Howard, right, so for the following
130240	140560	year, and then he worked at Brad Hutchinson Cancer Center, and then he moved to University
140560	147600	of Florida, and last semester, he joined again. So today, he's going to talk about epidemiology
147680	155520	and ecology of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus.
162160	166480	Okay, good. Thank you, Liang, for this nice introduction and over compliment.
167040	176160	I'm not expert in everything, and I mainly specialize in modeling of infectious disease
176160	183280	transmission, and just started working with Dr. Liu on how to combine the epidemiological part
183280	190000	and the physiological part into the same model so that we can better model the dynamics of
190000	197200	transmission. Today, I'm going to talk about epidemiology and the ecology of MERS-CoV.
199440	204560	If you read the flyer before, I changed my title a little bit. I used to have
204560	211360	transmission as well, but I found myself too many. I had to cut some, so I moved that one out.
212000	214960	So today, we'll only be talking about epidemiology and the ecology.
216080	223280	Hopefully, you will be interested in these topics. So this is during the work with Dr.
223280	230720	Yichun Fang and Wenqiang Shi at Beijing Institute of Microbiology and Epidemiology, as well as Dr.
230800	236240	Anna Zhang at Shandong University. Anna was a business student in my lab at UF.
237360	242400	That's when she was leading this project, part of this project.
243920	246720	Please feel free to stop me anytime if you have any questions.
247360	251360	So some background about the disease and the pathogen as well.
253040	257120	You're probably quite familiar with this disease because of the pandemic of SARS-CoV-2.
259120	266400	MERS is a respiratory infection disease first found in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
267200	276640	As of January this year, there were a total of 27 countries that have reported about 2,600
276640	284880	lab-confirmed cases, together with 935 deaths. So that's a pretty good number.
285840	296240	That has reported about 2,600 lab-confirmed cases, together with 935 deaths. So that's a
296240	300960	pretty high case fatality rate. We use the CMR of about 36%.
303440	309440	Luckily, human-to-human transmission is pretty rare, and many occurred in healthcare settings
309440	317360	and households. And in healthcare settings, it's pretty much patients who are immune-compromised.
317360	320720	So that's why they are at high risk of transmission.
322160	327280	And the zoonotic infection is mainly driven by exposure to the dummy debris,
327920	335600	wire droplets, fomites, and consumption of some raw products of this animal, such as milk.
336320	341280	And people also suspect the use of chemical urine as a traditional medicine is another
341280	351280	transmission route. And given that there has been no effective treatment or vaccine yet,
351280	356880	so people are very concerned about the potential of this virus causing another global pandemic
356880	364720	if it's fully adapted itself to the human population. And in 2018, WHO incorporated MERS
364720	372480	into its research and development blueprint, which lists a variety of disease pathogens
372480	378080	that people will spend more time developing vaccines toward those pathogens.
385280	393120	And about the virus itself, it's an RNA virus with a genome about 30 kb long.
395520	406480	And MERS-CoV belongs to the lineage C of the genus beta coronavirus. The famous or infamous
406480	413440	SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, they belong to the lineage B. And the common code coronaviruses,
413440	420800	OC43 and HKU1, they belong to the lineage K. So they're related, but a little bit distant
420800	430400	from each other. MERS-CoV was phylogenetically classified into clade A and clade B. A includes
430960	437920	the early detected human cases, viruses, and B includes the more contemporary viruses.
437920	445440	But however, this classification was based on a pretty few number of sequences. So we've done
445440	449280	a much more comprehensive work on this, and we'll show that later.
452960	459600	Although the disease was quite new, but circulation of MERS-like coronaviruses
463280	470080	in Africa and the Arabian Peninsula occurred well before 2012.
471040	478640	And a little bit about the immunity background of this virus. The virus used the S1 protein
478640	487360	to bind to two types of host cell surface molecules. One is called the DPP4, and the other
487360	495280	is the well-known alpha-2 or alpha-3 astatic acids. And it replicates mainly in the nasal
495840	505680	epithelium of dromedaries, but only in the lower respiratory tract of humans. So that's probably
505680	513360	why it's so highly transmissible among the dromedaries, but not so much among human beings.
516320	520480	All right, so that's enough for the background. Let me get into the needs.
520800	528480	We'll try to identify determinants for case fatality rate and also characterize the spatial
528480	534480	division pattern of the disease. And we want to also look at evolution and migration history
534480	541840	of the virus. Finally, we'll provide some more comprehensive picture about the ecology of the
541840	548000	virus. And we'll also look at the evolution and migration history of the virus, and we'll also
548000	553920	picture about the ecology of the virus and associated socio-environmental drivers.
554960	559440	But this talk has two parts. The first two are part one, and this is part two.
570720	574160	So in this slide, I talk about the data sources.
574960	581760	We first collected data on all confirmed human cases, and there are three major sources for that.
583040	592080	We looked at the official reports of WHO. Now, WHO does not provide the line list it used to.
592080	599120	So we were lucky. At that time, we got a line list. And the Food and Agriculture Organization
599680	606000	of the United Nations, as well as the health departments of affected countries.
607600	613680	So we collected demographic data whenever it's available, and the dates of
615600	622000	critical events, like the onset, hospitalization, and the lab confirmation.
623360	628160	The most important one is to explore your history, but it's very simple. It's just whether
628160	638880	the case has had a history of exposure to animal production or other confirmed patient.
639600	648960	And we validate this data via literature research. We also collected a bunch of socio-environmental
648960	656480	variables, which are listed here, and we'll utilize them, especially using, for example,
656480	664720	meteorological data and land cover data for ecology study. The gene sequence data were
664720	672720	downloaded from our gene bank, and we used data up to the June of 2020, and that's also
673280	678880	the time upper limit for the case data we downloaded.
687360	693360	This is an epidemic curve actually provided in the WHO report, and it only listed cases
694240	703200	in the eastern Mediterranean region. It's not for the whole world, but because we want to
703200	711520	check the seasonality, so we decided to focus on the endemic in the zoonotic region instead of the
711520	720640	local region. And it covers from June 2012 to January 2023. This is more comprehensive than
720640	728000	the data that we used. We used up to June of 2020, but luckily there weren't many cases after that.
729920	735040	I mentioned it was first discovered in September 2012, but you can see here,
735040	738960	actually the earliest case shown here can be traced back to early
738960	743440	2012, so there could be some cases retrospectively identified.
745360	751360	All right. Majority of these cases from Saudi Arabia. That's understandable. Everyone knows that.
752640	761520	And we see a huge peak in 2014 and some subsequent large outbreaks in 2015.
761520	767680	And you can also see there were about two peaks per year and sometimes three peaks
769440	778480	right. One in the early spring and the other one probably in the late summer or early fall.
779600	788000	And the early ones in the spring, it's more like an animal exposure in a triggered spinoma.
788000	802320	So here is a summary table of the kind of baseline characteristics of all the
802960	807040	worst cases we included in our study covering this period.
807760	814240	Right. And I colored some of these interesting results.
817200	823120	In Saudi Arabia, it has far more number of cases as well as number of deaths
823120	829920	compared to other countries. And if you look at the CFR, it's also much higher than other regions.
830720	834240	In South Korea, I should say South Korea, sorry for that,
835840	845280	the number of female patients were much higher than other countries.
847040	851840	That's possibly due to, because in Korea, if you know the history of MERS,
851840	857040	there was a big outbreak in, if I remember correctly, it was in 2015.
858000	866400	It's kind of driven by one single imported case. And that patient kind of stimulated large outbreaks
866400	872480	in several hospitals. So it's purely kind of a person-to-person transmission. And in that case,
873040	878960	it doesn't really distinguish between different sexes, right? But for animal exposure, we'll see
879440	887920	later, most of the patients with animal exposure are men. And so that will make some difference.
888720	898720	And in these countries, KSA, UAE, and some other countries, the majority of patients are male.
899600	905600	And South Korea also has a very large percent of hospital-related
906720	912080	patients. And that's exactly because we only had hospital outbreaks in that country.
914480	922320	And the time from disease onset to diagnosis was shortest in South Korea. And that's also
922320	927280	understandable because those were hospital-triggered investigations. They are very efficient, right?
928240	941600	In the United Arab Emirates, we noticed that the age was, the patients were much younger
941600	947920	compared to other countries. And that is probably because of the high proportion of healthcare
947920	955040	workers compared to other countries. And this country also has the highest proportion of
955040	966320	asymptomatic infection. How you identify asymptomatic infection is a very tricky question.
966960	976800	Usually, for syndrome-based surveillance, you only can find symptomatic cases. Because of
976800	982640	this high proportion of healthcare workers, probably they did some regular monitoring
982720	987280	for infection status. And that's how they identified asymptomatic infections.
989840	996640	And this country also has a very long time from disease onset to death. The reason for that
996640	1006080	is unknown, but probably related to the management of patient or facility in the hospitals.
1008720	1011280	So that's for the summary table. Any questions?
1013440	1021200	Okay. So that's the basic epidemiology. Let's go to more interesting materials.
1022960	1031360	In this table, we compare the characteristics between cases with animal contact and those without.
1032240	1038880	About one-fourth of patients were reported animal contact.
1040800	1047200	So we can see patients with animal contact were much less likely to be female
1048720	1059920	compared to this proportion. And they were older. And the case fatality rate was much higher.
1061840	1068400	But we need to be very careful for interpreting this much higher case fatality rate. Because
1068400	1073680	this animal contact, we'll see later, it's confounded with other factors like age,
1073680	1080960	like baseline chronic conditions. If we really want to assess animal contact
1081600	1085840	effect on case fatality rate, we need to adjust for those confounders.
1086800	1095120	It's also less likely to be asymptomatic. But that, again, is a question mark. That probably
1095120	1106400	does not give you any epidemiological... It doesn't describe epidemiology in that regard
1106400	1112160	faithfully. Because for people with animal contact, many of them probably asymptomatic,
1112480	1115520	asymptomatic, and they were not captured by this learning system.
1118640	1123280	And they had much higher proportion of underlying conditions, as I mentioned before.
1124480	1130240	So they're probably at higher risk to death. And they generally had a much longer time from
1130240	1137120	the disease onset to diagnosis. So we'll find later. So that will also probably increase the
1137120	1145280	fatality rate. But for some reason, a slightly longer time from disease onset to death,
1145280	1152240	which we don't quite understand, probably related to some immunology issues.
1153120	1158560	If we look at the proportion of animal contact, a patient with animal contact,
1158560	1162160	across the years, now these proportions are the low proportions.
1162720	1169360	Even though we had fewer and fewer cases over the years, we actually see a different story
1169360	1175440	for this proportion of animal contact. It increases up to 2018, and then they kind of
1175440	1180400	plateaued. And it's not decreasing yet. I'm not sure about the most recent years.
1180400	1183760	The data is not available yet.
1196240	1203680	So this figure shows the spatial distribution of human MERS cases in the whole globe.
1204080	1212640	We categorize the countries into four categories. The first two categories
1213760	1223520	corresponds to the colors of, I would say, maybe I can call that pink, and a little bit of purple.
1224080	1232880	Those countries had zoonotic transmissions, basically animal exposure. The pink ones
1233040	1239200	reported a human-to-human transmission, and the purple one did not report,
1239200	1244240	or at least did not find concrete evidence for human-to-human transmission.
1244880	1250080	And if you look at this map, only Kuwait is the country colored with purple.
1251520	1256640	And it doesn't really mean it did not have human-to-human transmission. I'll explain why.
1257600	1263120	The other two categories are the countries with many important infections,
1263760	1271280	so they're colored with yellow or brown. The yellow indicates there was human-to-human
1271280	1278640	transmission following the importation. And the brown ones, I believe,
1280480	1286160	are the ones without subsequent human-to-human. Oh no, sorry, it's reversed. The yellow ones,
1286480	1292240	did not have human-to-human transmission, but the brown ones had this type of incidence.
1294720	1301680	All right, and for each country with reported cases, we impose a bar chart like this,
1302320	1308160	and the size of the bar indicates number of cases, and then the colors indicate
1309280	1315520	animal contact history. The red indicates the proportion of patients with animal contact.
1316160	1324400	And if you look at Kuwait, it's basically red and green. Green simply means unknown,
1325200	1330960	right? So whether there were human-to-human transmission, we don't know, just not confirmed.
1333200	1339360	And interestingly, Qatar is the country with the highest proportion of animal contact,
1340160	1350240	followed by ASA, UAE, and Oman. Some small countries like these,
1351520	1358560	Bahrain has too few cases, so I wouldn't make any conclusion for that.
1358560	1378000	Some European countries also reported patients with animal contact, as well as here in Southeast
1378000	1388080	Asia. But these people most likely already had animal contact before they entered
1388560	1400320	those countries. So to look at what factors contributed to the risk of death,
1400320	1410480	so we performed a standard logistic regression. For all the variables that we have that we think
1410480	1415200	are related, we throw them into the model, we perform the univariable analysis and the
1415200	1421840	multivariable analysis, and all these factors we throw in are significant in both univariable and
1421840	1431840	multivariable analysis. These are strong predictors for case fatality. Let's just go ahead with the
1431840	1443280	multivariable analysis. Don't look at the age, sex, and animal contact yet, because we have
1443280	1451120	interaction terms in the model. And these numbers, like this high number, 10.52, does not represent a
1451120	1456560	marginal effect of age group. It does not. It's just specific to one particular subgroup, and I'll talk
1456560	1465520	about that later. So let's just look at the effects of, say, a healthcare worker, as much lower risk
1465520	1475680	of death. And underlying condition, well, that's a more than three-fold increase in the risk of death.
1477520	1486160	OTC stands for the time from onset to confirmation, it's basically diagnosis, right? Then
1486560	1495200	this has also a significant result. A longer time from onset to confirmation
1495200	1502800	increases the risk of death. And if we compare the years, we divide the time into three segments,
1502800	1508880	and this early phase, this middle phase with large outbreaks, and this later phase with very few cases.
1509440	1516640	And all compared to the early years, we can see a jump in the risk of death. That's probably,
1517360	1524160	at least partly due to the constrained, exhausted healthcare facilities, because the large number
1524160	1530720	of patients. And in the later years, we see a slightly decrease in the risk of death,
1531280	1539600	possibly related to improved patient management, and also the much fewer number of patients.
1541440	1550080	So we left out the most three interesting factors, age, sex, and animal contact. So let's get into those.
1550640	1559440	In this table, we look at age effect, conditioning on sex and animal contact.
1562640	1571040	Let's focus on the adjusted odd ratio directly. These are all pretty big numbers,
1571600	1579120	these are all pretty big numbers, all significant. But let's do some comparison.
1579760	1589120	Let's first compare the results between female and male, right?
1589120	1593760	But you have to condition on the same contact history, right? So with contact history, with
1593760	1602640	animal contact history, if you compare female with male, and then without contact history, female with
1609120	1613680	female with male, right? Without actually comparing this guy, this guy with that guy.
1614560	1621440	So basically, this is bigger than that, and this is bigger than that. So within females,
1622080	1627440	age effect is more prominent, regardless of animal contact history.
1630880	1637200	Age effect is basically comparing the older age to the younger age.
1638480	1644160	And this number shows in the previous table, it's just for this particular subset of population.
1644880	1653600	So age is the most prominent driver for the risk of death. And that's not affected by
1655440	1663120	by either sex or, no, it is affected by sex, right? In female, it's more prominent.
1663680	1670080	And it's not that affected, it is also affected by animal contact. Let's compare the animal contact history.
1670240	1682880	So if you look at, just compare with to without, with to without, and with to without,
1684400	1692160	you can see without animal contact, age effect is more prominent, regardless of the underlying sex.
1692160	1699760	So that's quite interesting. Why is that? Why is that?
1703120	1711200	Remember, males, many of them were actually farm workers, they had animal exposure. So
1713280	1720800	we can reasonably speculate that these patients were constantly challenged by the virus.
1722960	1728800	Okay, probably that's a buildup of immunity towards this virus.
1730080	1736640	So after adjusting for the underlying conditions, and adjusted for the
1740560	1744000	yeah, adjusted for underlying conditions and some other risk factors,
1744960	1754320	we can see the difference in the age group between people with, without animal contact.
1754320	1760320	With animal contact, the age effect is not that prominent, but without, it is very prominent.
1763040	1772400	And most of the animal workers, they were older than younger. So that's for age effect.
1772480	1776480	Let's look at the effect of gender.
1785440	1794160	We don't see many strong signals. The only statistically significant result is within
1794160	1802240	the subgroup of male, the older patients without animal contact.
1804000	1808000	And male has a much higher risk of death than female.
1810560	1819600	However, we also noticed that this effect is, you know, has some kind of a marginal signal here.
1819600	1823600	And it is in the opposite direction compared to what we see here.
1823600	1830080	And this subgroup is for the younger, no, for the older patients with animal contact.
1834320	1839360	So that's, that's also quite interesting. For younger patients without animal contact,
1840000	1846160	male has much higher risk of death. But within older patients with animal contact,
1846560	1852960	male has actually lower risk of death.
1855520	1859680	And that again, give us a difficult question to answer, why is that?
1860880	1868800	However, we should also notice that within the category of older patients with animal contact
1868800	1875200	and female, we have small number. So that's why this is not statistically significant.
1876160	1884480	So that could be just due to random noise. So maybe we should not over-interpret this 0.45.
1887680	1894080	You actually use a mouse because I don't think, and this is my laser point, that means online.
1895840	1898320	You cannot see that? You actually use mouse.
1898320	1905760	Yeah, let me use mouse. I apologize to the online audience.
1908240	1915680	All right, now finally, let's look at the effect of animal contact conditioning on sex and age group.
1916640	1931120	Now, here, let's just focus on the significant results. The most significant result is this guy.
1931120	1936640	That's ignored, unknown category, just to focus on what we've done.
1936960	1943440	Right, so within the subgroup of female patients and younger female patients,
1944080	1953520	we see a huge increased risk of death for patients with animal contact.
1955200	1962240	Remember, these are female patients. Most animal workers were males.
1962240	1972080	So females, if they had animal contact, it's probably more likely to be a vocational contact,
1972080	1979680	not a professional contact. So that means you may not have to build up immunity against this virus.
1980880	1987600	Right, so once you had contact with animal and got infected, then it's probably a high risk of
1987600	1994960	death. And this virus just jumped from animal to human, has not been adapted much to the human
1995520	2003200	immune system. But if you look at the subgroup of male patients, the older male patients,
2004160	2009920	if you look at with, without animal contact, you see a huge reduction in the risk of death.
2010160	2014720	And most of these male patients with animal contact, especially the older ones,
2015440	2023280	they were actually animal workers. They had probably long exposure to the virus.
2030080	2037280	Any questions? A lot of information here, difficult to digest in such a short time.
2039920	2060000	Oh, I already see people have put in chat. Okay, let's move on. So those were for the
2060560	2066560	risk factors for death. Now let's look at the spatial diffusion pattern.
2070080	2082160	So what we did here is we look at the time from the first case overall to the first case
2082160	2089920	in each local district. That's the first time the local district was invaded by this virus.
2090560	2100320	With this time as my outcome, I did some, you know, spatial smoothing to construct this contour
2100320	2113760	plot. And this contour plot can tell me the diffusion pattern. And the wider gap between the
2114720	2130880	two contours indicates, let me put it this way, because the gap between each contour plot is
2131680	2140320	kind of fixed for the time interval, 200 days. And a wider gap means a longer spatial distance.
2141120	2154320	So that means a faster spread, right? The first case, first case was here in a city
2154320	2164800	called Bisho, somewhere in south, in western KSA. And this star marks the first patient that
2164800	2174480	sparked a outbreak, human patient cluster. So this Bisho is kind of in the central
2176240	2186000	point of these contour plots. And in the more recent times, we can see actually faster spreading
2186000	2193600	and the direction was towards Oman and somewhere of UAE.
2196560	2204560	Right. But that's a characteristic of this plot. We did not show the uncertainty, right?
2204560	2212160	So probably here you have fewer data, then uncertainty could be high. And whether the
2212160	2219200	conclusion that they have fastest spreading, maybe just a noise. But however, if you look
2219200	2227200	at this figure, this map here, let me use mouse again. If you look at the map in the right panel,
2227920	2234880	you can see in this corner, we still have a bunch of cases. So those cases will inform
2234880	2241120	the construction of this contour plot. So the signal here in this corner should be reliable.
2243120	2250880	Right. And you can also notice that we overlay this map with the transportation network.
2251440	2260320	The white, black lines indicate railway and these gray lines indicate the major roads.
2262000	2268080	And you can see a pretty good overlap of the cases with this transportation network.
2268080	2272400	And that's what we're going to show in another model fitting.
2279520	2286560	So here we perform the survival analysis. Again, the outcome is a time from the first
2286560	2296640	ever reported worst case to the first importation of case into each district.
2297200	2305680	The so-called district here, it is a second level administrative unit in most countries,
2305680	2313200	except for KSA. Because KSA is relatively big. So in case A, we use county, which is a third level
2313200	2322240	administrative area. And we fit this survival model, trying to look at, this is not an
2322240	2326560	ecological model. It's just to try to look at what might have contributed to
2327360	2332400	the invasion of the virus into these different spatial units. Right. Again,
2332400	2338160	that's just a look at the multivariable analysis. And here we are estimating hazard ratio.
2343040	2349440	The most prominent hazard ratio is related to the intersection with the main road.
2349760	2360320	So after that, it was elevation, the higher elevation, the higher hazard ratio.
2361520	2368000	And also intersection with railway, it more than doubled the hazard of invasion.
2370080	2377040	And interestingly, the coverage of cropland, it seems to deter the spread, which is also
2377040	2393600	understandable. These bio variables, they are meteorological variables. And I listed the
2393600	2401040	interpretations here. Bio one is simply the annual average temperature. And the bio two is the
2401040	2405760	average diurnal range of temperature, which is simply is kind of the average.
2408160	2413040	The difference between the maximum temperature and a minimum temperature within each month,
2413040	2421440	then you take an average. It reflects the variation over time, but within each month.
2422080	2429600	So these two had shown some significant results, increasing the higher temperature or the higher
2430400	2434480	mortality, increase the hazard of invasion.
2445280	2449360	Finally, comes down to the something that may be interesting.
2449840	2459120	So we collected the whole genome sequence from GenBank. And we analyzed these sequences using
2459120	2468960	the toolkits provided by Nextstrain. The sequences were aligned using MAFFT, what do you call it?
2469760	2484080	MAFFT? MAFFT. And the alignment was trained to a reference genome in GenBank. And we constructed
2484080	2492400	the phylogenetic tree using the maximum likelihood approach implemented in the IQ tree software.
2493200	2502320	And for the final geographic analysis, we use the tree time to estimate, you know,
2502320	2510240	the location and host time of those internal nerves. And initial analysis shown on the left
2510880	2514240	panel suggested that
2516480	2525120	the sequences from bats, I think by these pink leaf nodes, and hedgehog,
2525680	2534640	not by the yellow leaf nodes, they separated kind of distant from the main clades of sequences
2534640	2544080	formed by humans and camels, as well as a single strain from a llama, I think, the animal.
2545200	2547440	It is hiding here.
2552880	2563200	And we, so then we just exclude all the sequences of bats and hedgehogs and only focus on the
2564960	2567840	human and the camel genes.
2574160	2581760	So on the right hand panel, you can see we had several clusters for human and camel genes.
2581760	2590400	We have five clusters. The largest cluster is called C5, which contains majority of the sequences.
2591280	2600480	And you can see the mixture of human and camel sequences throughout the tree, except for the
2600480	2606880	most recent ones, where I think this was more like a sampling using, rather than a
2609920	2617840	systematic pattern. So this mixture of human-camel sequences
2618320	2625920	suggests that there were probably constant importation of sphere number from camel to human.
2634000	2640000	Now, this figure shows the phylogeny in a much better way because we can we can
2640400	2649040	time here, right? So although the human and camel sequences are mixed together,
2649040	2653680	but if you look at the samples collected after 2016,
2655520	2661520	the human genes are quite distant from the camel genes, right?
2662080	2671520	And the common ancestor was dated around 2007, and the posterior probability for the host being
2671520	2677520	camel, human, kind of 50-50. We later did a sensitivity analysis. We downsampled the human
2678320	2685040	sequences because there's just too many of them. And then the camel will have a 99%
2685040	2693120	for the posterior probability being the common ancestor.
2695920	2700240	We also tried to associate case fatality rate with sequences.
2700240	2705520	So what we did is we look at, we kind of divide the spatial temporal
2707760	2713760	range into several chunks and calculate the case fatality rate within each chunk.
2713760	2720720	And then we look at the individual sequences and associate them with the case fatality rate
2721680	2731600	in that chunk, the location and the time. And then we, for each sequence, we have a bar
2731600	2737440	with a color indicating the underlying case fatality rate in that space time chunk.
2738160	2745120	And then we average for each cluster to compare the potential difference in case fatality rate
2746240	2757040	between clusters. If you compare C5 to other clusters, C1 to C4, you cannot really see much
2757040	2763280	difference between the two. Actually, there's only 1% difference in case fatality rate there,
2763280	2769920	only 1%. But it is significant, probably because of the sample size, but we cannot
2769920	2780960	fully interpret that. If you compare only the sub-clade C5.1 with C1 to C4, we actually see
2780960	2790640	a 4% difference, which is not true. So that means the more recent clade is probably more lethal.
2794240	2802560	We also associated the incidence rate with sequences, but we cannot see much signal there,
2802560	2816560	so I'm going to ignore that. Oh, there's another thing I want to share. Okay, so we,
2817280	2822560	remember, we performed some phylogeographic analysis. So let's take a look at a movie.
2823360	2826160	Hopefully, this movie will show. Let's see.
2832800	2834160	Just a copy-paste.
2834160	2857520	Oh, we're not. We should go back to the window mode, and just copy-paste this one.
2864160	2871520	Let's see if we can do it.
2871520	2896880	Let's see if it works or not.
2897840	2912240	Oh, I have to move it to...
2919440	2922240	Oh, I have to stop sharing.
2922320	2925600	Oh, I see, I see. Yeah, okay.
2933600	2939600	Let me click on it here.
2939600	2954400	I want to see that geographic location.
2958240	2959920	I'm scrolling down, maybe.
2960320	2961040	Scrolling down.
2965920	2969280	All right, yes, and then replay.
2971280	2976320	I'm sorry for this problem, but it's kind of out of my control.
2979040	2980000	Where is play?
2980000	2981040	Just click play.
2981440	2986400	Okay, yeah, now let's take a look.
2986400	3011360	Yeah, it's almost finished. All right, good.
3011360	3012960	Good, okay.
3016080	3020160	Now, let me... Oh, still, that's correct to share a screen, right?
3026720	3029840	Right, okay.
3029840	3033280	Now, some highlights for that movie, right?
3033600	3054640	The top three most likely locations for the common access route were three cities, Riyadh of KSA and now Delta region, which is in Egypt and Jordan.
3055360	3062480	The possibilities are 31%, 17% and 12% respectively.
3063040	3071760	And Riyadh appears to be the major source of exporting infections, both locally and internationally.
3072960	3082720	And it is the common ancestor node of subclades C3, C4 and C5 for 99% of time.
3085600	3095120	Okay, and the early exportation to Egypt and Jordan occurred well before 2010.
3095680	3104080	And the circulation of the MERS-CoV among camels in East Africa possibly started also before 2010.
3105040	3116960	The virus migrated from Egypt to Ethiopia during 2011-2013, and subsequently to Kenya during 2014-2017.
3117840	3128560	And that's partially supported by a zoological study conducted in Egypt in 2013, where they also sampled animals from Kenya and found nothing.
3129520	3146800	The intense migration from Riyadh towards local cities in KSA, as well as Abu Dhabi in UAE, started around the 1970s, which matches our knowledge.
3146800	3156080	And Abu Dhabi joined Riyadh as the second home for exporting the virus, both locally and internationally. So that's quite early.
3156160	3165120	And the model also captures the opportunistic exportation to the US as well as to the US.
3170960	3177280	So we also did some kind of detection of
3177840	3190640	positive selection across proteins and the sites. Remember in the previous slide, see here.
3191280	3199600	Now I'm notating here branch A and branch B. Branch A is kind of separating
3199840	3207040	the hedgehog sequences from the rest, and branch B is separating hedgehog and
3208240	3213840	bat sequences from human and camel sequences. So we performed the
3215760	3219200	positive selection analysis along these two branches.
3219760	3238480	Okay, the first three rows of branch A, we identified three proteins, the non-structural three, nucleoprotein, and this 1AB polyprotein is, I believe, it's from the open reading form 1.
3238480	3243920	I may be wrong, but that's my impression. And we identified the signs
3244080	3254320	with positive selection. Only in this 1AB polyprotein, not in the other two. Along the branch B, we identified these two proteins, including the spike protein.
3255120	3261840	For the branch A, we did not detect the spike protein for any positive selection.
3262560	3268800	And also for the spike protein, we identified these sides to be under high
3269280	3280480	pressure for positive selection. And the three ones marked by red, those are newly found. They did not appear in the literature.
3284480	3293120	And we all know spike protein is the one that most interacts with animal cells.
3294080	3295280	How much time do I have?
3297680	3298240	It's already...
3298240	3299680	Yeah, already 10 seconds.
3299680	3308880	Okay, okay. Then I'll probably ignore the ecology part. For the ecology part, I can just mention some main findings.
3309440	3317520	What we did here is we used several machine learning approaches like post-signal regression tree,
3318240	3326720	supported by commission, and random forest to learn the ecology of the spike protein.
3327280	3342880	And then we build a meta-learner on top of this. It will give us another round of prediction, and it turns out that the ensemble machine, which is a meta-learner,
3342880	3359440	outperforms the three base models. Not by much, but a little bit. If you look at the AUC, if you look at the accuracy, as well as F1 score and compound,
3359920	3383600	not really a good performance in terms of sensitivity, but sensitivity here is a little bit deceptive because we have very few positive cases.
3384160	3394160	This model is based on about 100 positive districts with confirmed cases, and about 400
3397360	3399200	districts without any detection.
3399280	3412560	And we did identify... Let me see. We did identify the most prominent risk driver for ecology of MERS-CoV. It's actually something called the coverage of bare land.
3412560	3421520	Bare land, that's very, very difficult to define. Basically, a land without many, you know, vegetation, trees, like that, right?
3423280	3427760	But we also adjusted for camel density here. Camel density is picked up by the model,
3429120	3435600	but not as a very prominent driver. So we want to control the camel density. Then it's bare land,
3436160	3442160	in addition to camel, it may also contain other animal hosts that we have not discovered yet.
3450160	3457360	Okay, so let me just draw some conclusions on the epithelium model.
3458080	3461120	So we observed that the cases with animal contact
3462320	3470560	tend to be older, more likely to be male, symptomatic, and also having underlying conditions. Even though by our
3471440	3477040	logistic model with interactions, we kind of see that once you adjust your model,
3477520	3487280	underlying conditions, adjusting for age and gender, animal contact actually does not always increase the risk of death.
3488160	3495440	Remember, in the older population, and male, it actually decreases the risk of death.
3496240	3499600	But overall, for those older males who are farm workers, animal workers, because they had underlying conditions, and they were old,
3500800	3508880	overall, they do have a higher risk of death.
3509520	3512720	So we should consider promoting some preventive measures, like an educational campaign or personal protection equipment for those workers.
3514320	3522160	But overall, for those older males who are farm workers, animal workers, because they had underlying conditions, and they were old,
3522160	3527840	overall, they do have a higher risk of death. And we need to pay attention to that.
3529360	3536320	So we should consider promoting some preventive measures, like an educational campaign or personal protection equipment for those workers.
3537280	3545760	And animal-to-human transmission events mainly occurred between January and March,
3546800	3551680	and human-to-human transmission occurred later in summer.
3551680	3558240	So that suggests the importance of blocking the spillover from animal to human in the early spring.
3558880	3569920	And also mentioning, we found sample sequences after 2014, many human sequences, and then camel becomes the host for the root ancestor with a very high possibility.
3569920	3577920	And we also found Abu Dhabi of UAE is a hub for international exportation of this virus.
3578000	3584000	So this virus, probably, we should recommend some kind of screening procedure for infected travelers.
3584000	3590480	And the novel amino acids positions that we found on spike protein associated with public selection,
3590480	3596640	those can be potential pockets for the spread of this virus.
3596640	3602640	So we should consider promoting some preventive measures, like an educational campaign or personal protection equipment for those workers.
3602800	3604800	And the novel amino acids positions that we found on spike protein associated with public selection,
3604800	3611520	those can be potential pockets for development of future antiviral vaccines against this virus.
3612560	3617600	So that's all for that material.
3619760	3626240	And the NP paper is published in this journal, and the ecology paper is published in this journal.
3626240	3628800	Thank you very much. Any questions, you're welcome.
3632640	3649120	Yes, please. I'm really interested about the phylogeny. Can you go back to the figure four or five?
3649520	3667680	Yeah, that's the one. So, since after 2016, it's really interesting, like, human birds and
3667680	3673760	camels are pretty much distinct. Do you think it's because the sampling bios of the camel,
3673760	3681280	or do you believe there's somehow a low level circulation of human population?
3681280	3689120	That's a good question. I don't have the answer. My intuition is sampling virus is at least a contributing factor.
3690480	3696800	It's hard to imagine, because this virus is endemic in camels. It's hard to imagine it's gone. I don't think it's gone.
3696800	3705920	So, Ryan in the chat would like to know what type of models make up your own sample.
3705920	3712960	Oh, so the base models are a random forest, boosted regression tree, and
3713760	3720160	support vector machine. And then on top of that, the meta-learner is actually XGBoost.
3720160	3728160	Does that answer your question?
3728160	3729200	Yes, thank you.
3734880	3740400	Yes, so it seems like this is a fairly small tree. Why did you end up choosing
3741440	3747760	using the Nextstrain pipeline as opposed to a different tree building pipeline?
3748640	3756880	It was not my decision. My intuition would always try maybe like a beast first.
3758880	3765360	However, I wouldn't say it's a small data set either, because we have, I think, about 500 sequences together.
3766320	3772640	A beast may need some time to run. And another nice thing about the Nextstrain is that it provides
3773040	3780320	all sorts of tools together for you to use, and with this nice movie. So I think that's
3780320	3786080	probably the only reason why we chose Nextstrain. But I think definitely you can try a beast as well,
3786880	3791280	especially for the geographic analysis.
3792960	3800240	Could you tell us more about surveillance or genome sequencing of camel or
3800240	3805520	reservoir species? I think that's really important because it can give us a
3806080	3812640	good background about circulation in these reservoirs and spillover between them.
3814080	3819600	I'm not quite sure whether there is a systematic surveillance system for animals.
3821200	3829520	Actually, in terms of animal hosts, although at least the bats and hedgehogs here
3831200	3837840	if you look into the literature, it's still kind of debatable, right? We all have common sense.
3837840	3843760	Bats is the natural reservoir for all types of coronaviruses, including MERS,
3844400	3850320	MERS-CoV. But as a matter of fact, so far people have only found, to my knowledge,
3851280	3856080	kind of similar gene segments in the virus as in the form of bats.
3856720	3862320	That's not considered some very solid evidence by many of our biologists and immunologists.
3864560	3870320	Yeah, I know less about the hedgehogs, so I cannot say much about that.
3871200	3877760	So the primary animal host that's solidly convincing people is camels,
3878240	3882960	scum, gondolins. And we should do surveillance.
3885840	3890160	I have a question about student training because you're applying for adjunct
3891760	3897680	faculty position here. So what kind, what type of students would you expect working in your lab,
3897680	3904480	or how would you train bioinformatics students? In terms of bioinformatics itself,
3905440	3914480	I need a partner like Dr. Liu. Myself, no, I cannot train you. I'm very interested in this
3915040	3922400	field, but myself, I need to be trained as well. But my vision is that, you know,
3922400	3929600	we don't have this vision. We want to combine biological data, gene sequence data. So far,
3929600	3933440	we're only talking about the pathogen sequence, right? It could be human sequence as well,
3933440	3939760	but that's a long shot. And also like human movement data, all together to inform us about
3939760	3945680	the transmission dynamics. And that's also very important to understand how the virus is going to
3946720	3951440	evolve in terms of its transmissibility, pathogenicity, and so on.
3954000	3961920	So far, there have been some efforts in this kind of joint modeling in the past 10 years, but
3963440	3971440	it's still under investigated. It's still a very promising direction. So anybody with interest in
3971440	3980160	both bioinformatics and statistics and computational methods are welcome to join this effort.
3984480	3990400	Yeah, sure. It says elevation was insignificant in the univariable analysis. Why was it included
3990400	3994800	in the multivariable and into that mix? Good question. Let me check.
3996640	4005920	Elevation. That's for the survival analysis, is that? Yes.
4005920	4011040	Yeah.
4019600	4026560	Oh, this is kind of more like a statistical philosophy question,
4027520	4034640	right? Because here, we did not explore the potential interactions explicitly.
4035440	4042160	So there could be interactions among these factors. And in the univariable analysis,
4042160	4047440	it's not significant. Actually, the p-value is very close to one, but that does not mean
4048480	4054480	it's not having an interaction. Or it could be a confounder. Because if you look at the
4054480	4061760	coverage of a bare land with elevation, there is some correlation there.
4062720	4066880	Right? Not very high, not super high, but there is some substantial correlation there.
4066880	4072240	So we cannot just rule it out. In the multivariable model, we did not just leave
4072240	4080320	out those non-significant in the multivariate model. We actually add them back one by one
4080320	4084960	to check whether they're going to become significant after adjusting for other factors.
4085600	4086480	So that's the reason.
4091120	4096240	Thank you. All right. If there's no questions, let's send Professor Gao.
4109200	4112800	Yeah, I think I set it up. I know I have to clean up, so I won't be there.
4115600	4118080	All right. I think that's something else.
4118960	4121680	Yeah. Should I go?
4121680	4127200	You can just show up. I'll show up at the booth, I guess.
